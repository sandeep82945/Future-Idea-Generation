Based on interactions between individuals and others and references to social norms, this study reveals the impact of heterogeneity in time preference on wealth distribution and inequality. We present a novel approach that connects the interactions between microeconomic agents that generate heterogeneity to the dynamic equations for capital and consumption in macroeconomic models. Using this approach, we estimate the impact of changes in the discount rate due to microeconomic interactions on capital, consumption and utility and the degree of inequality. The results show that intercomparisons with others regarding consumption significantly affect capital, i.e. wealth inequality. Furthermore, the impact on utility is never small and social norms can reduce this impact. Our supporting evidence shows that the quantitative results of inequality calculations correspond to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies. This study’s micro–macro connection approach can be deployed to connect microeconomic interactions, such as exchange, interest and debt, redistribution, mutual aid and time preference, to dynamic macroeconomic models. introduction Wealth inequality has become a significant social problem worldwide. According to the
World Inequality Report 2022 (Chancel et al., 2022), the top 1% of the wealthiest people account for 38% of the world’s wealth, while the World Economic Forum (2017)
found that only eight men have the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people. The global Gini index has reached 0.7 (Chancel et al., 2022), well above the warning level
of 0.4 for social unrest (United Nations Human Settlements Programme). Solving inequality is important because social unrest generates a vicious cycle that reduces
productivity, increases inequality and fuels social unrest (Sedik & Xu, 2020). According to the macroeconomics review literature on heterogeneity (Heathcote et al.,
2009), efforts to focus on microeconomic heterogeneity in macroeconomics have three main directions: individual endogenous heterogeneity and exogenous shocks, individual
insurance against exogenous risks and the interaction between idiosyncratic risks and aggregate dynamics. Concerning sources of heterogeneity, efforts have been made
regarding endogenous capabilities and preferences as initial conditions for individuals and transitory and persistent shocks as exogenous conditions. The importance of heterogeneity in individuals’ time preferences for wealth inequality is well known (Frederick et al., 2002). Individual wealth accumulation and consumption
are strongly influenced by how future values are discounted and heterogeneity in time preferences leads to wealth inequality. Considerable research has investigated the
relationship between time preference and inequality. The representative literature includes a model in which heterogeneity in discount rates leads to wealth concentration
(Becker, 1980), an empirical study of the relationship between heterogeneity in time preference and inequality (Lawrance, 1991) and a model to explain inequality from the
distribution of discount rates (Krusell & Smith, 1998). Additional studies include a model to estimate heterogeneity in time preferences from the distribution of inequality
(Hendricks, 2007), a model to account for inequality by adding consumer choice and human capital formation to heterogeneity in time preferences (Suen, 2014) and an
empirical study of the relationship between differences in saving behaviour and inequality based on the distribution of time preferences (Epper et al., 2020). Two main approaches exist to studying utility functions, including time preference: the constant and endogenous discount rates (Shi & Epstein, 1993). The constant rate is a
model that expresses instantaneous utility as consumption versus reference stock under a constant discount rate (Ryder & Heal, 1973; Carroll et al., 1997; Strulik, 2008). In
contrast, the endogenous discount rate adds the effect of endogenous habit formation to the discount rate for instantaneous utility (Uzawa, 1968; Epstein, 1987; Obstfeld, 1990;
Chang et al., 2011; Zhang, 2012). In dealing with heterogeneity in time preference, the model that deals with endogenous changes in discount rates is more suitable than the
model that deals with constant discount rates. Reviewing the literature on the measurement of time preference (Frederick et al., 2002;
Cohen et al., 2020) indicates three main measurement models: the exponential, hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic forms. The classical exponential form is a function
with the discount rate as the base and time as the exponent (Samuelson, 1937). The hyperbolic form is a function with the linear function of the term multiplied by the
discount rate and time as the base and the inverse of the discount rate as the exponent (Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991). The quasi-hyperbolic form is a function of the
exponential form multiplied by the present bias factor (Laibson, 1997). Wang et al. (2016) measured time preference in 53 countries based on quasi-hyperbolic forms,
which Rieger et al. (2021) combined with the sociological and social psychology survey literature to obtain universal time preference in 117 countries. Previous studies on time preference have identified the introduction of various heterogeneities (Sedik & Xu, 2020), reflecting the interaction of multiple psychological
motivations (Frederick et al., 2002) and considering psychological factors such as trust, confusion and context (Cohen et al., 2020), as future challenges. Concerning these
issues, social psychology has traditionally studied the close relationship between self and others (Markus & Wurf, 1987), while cognitive science has investigated the social
brain hypothesis that social groups influence the human brain (Dunbar, 2003). The comparative institutional analysis of microeconomics posits that shared expectations
constrain individual strategies and behaviours as a summary expression of the group’s equilibrium state (Aoki, 2001). Additionally, the theory of social norms related to public
economics states that social norms, including customs, manners and rules, broadly
originate from mutual expectations and approval with others based on sympathetic human tendencies (Heath, 2008). Therefore, it is essential to consider interactions with
others and social groups as psychological motivations and factors related to time preferences; however, while conventional economic studies on time preference have
examined the effects on individuals’ endogenous habit formation and preference changes for exogenous shocks, no studies focus on others’ interactions and social
context. The agent-based model (ABM) is an approach that introduces microeconomic
interactions into the macroeconomy. The related literature (Haldane & Turrell, 2018) states that macroeconomic ABM attempts to understand macro-level behaviour by
having rule-based interactions among agents (Turrell, 2016). Representative studies show phase transitions between low and high-unemployment economies by setting firm
production and price rules (Gualdi et al., 2015). Additional studies have shown that policy indicators such as gross domestic product, growth and unemployment rates by
modelling the behaviour of government, bank, firm and household agents (Caiani et al., 2016) and that business cycles are due to the interaction of agents’ decision-making
with cognitive restrictions (De Grauwe, 2010). Note that agents’ behaviour in macroeconomic ABM is rule-based and autonomous dynamic behaviour is discarded. Econophysics is an approach that uses ABM and focuses specifically on wealth distribution and inequality. The literature in this realm (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007;
Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010) shows that asset exchanges among many agents are modelled based on physical analogies to simulate various wealth distributions. Representative studies have shown that the gamma distribution is caused by the stochastic process of the exchange of assets other than savings (Angle, 1986) and that
the delta distribution uses the analogy of the kinetic energy exchange of gas particles (Chakraborti, 2002). Further research has shown that changes in tax rates and insurance
can cause exponential and gamma distributions to interchange (Guala, 2009; Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010). No macroeconomic models are incorporated into these
econophysical agents. This study aims to simulate the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility by
setting up a new dynamic model concerning both econophysics and macroeconomic
ABM. We also investigate the heterogeneity of time preference, i.e. discount rate, based on the interaction between individuals and others and the social context and norms. Econophysics has a physical analogy-based agent that differs from reality and the macroeconomic ABM has a behavioural rule-based agent. In contrast, this study takes
the approach of connecting microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic agents to incorporate the dynamic behaviour of autonomous agents. Unlike previous
studies that calculate wealth inequality from the distribution of pre-given time preferences (Suen, 2014), examine the relationship between measured time preference
distributions and inequality (Epper et al., 2020) or change time preferences through endogenous habit formation (Zhang, 2012), this study takes a unique approach. We
examine the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility generated by the distribution of time preferences generated from initial uniform time preferences through
interactions with others and social norms. Our approach is limited in that it assumes an impact on time preference by its interactions and social norms, but as with Zhang’s
habit formation, the actual survey researches suport the findings obtained. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The Methods section first refers to
the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model (Ramsey, 1928; Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965), one of the basic models of dynamic macroeconomics. On this basis, we show how to
calculate the dynamic saddle path and the utility for discount rate changes concerning capital and individual agents’ consumption. Following an econophysical approach, we
then formulate changes in the discount rates based on intercomparisons of capital or consumption among agents and references to social norms. Through repeated
interactions and references, the Results section simulates changes in the distribution of discount rates from initial uniform values and corresponding changes in the distribution
of wealth and utility. This section also presents the calculation results of coefficients of variation and Gini indices that represent inequality among agents. The Discussion
section considers the impact of intercomparisons and social norms on inequality, along with the interpretation of the results and mentions the potential of developing an
approach that connects microeconomic interactions other than time preference, such as exchange, debt, redistribution and mutual aid, to dynamic macroeconomics. Finally, the
Conclusion section presents the main inferences and addresses future issues. methods  dynamic macroeconomic model This study refers to the dynamic equations for capital and consumption in the Ramsey– Cass–Koopmans model as the basic dynamic macroeconomic model (Romer, 2019: 59– 60, 95; Nakata, 2011: 45). Suppose capital per individual (household) is 𝑘 , consumption is 𝑐, the production function is 𝑓(𝑘), the capital depletion rate is 𝛿, the labour growth rate is 𝜆, the knowledge growth rate is 𝜅, the discount rate of time preference is 𝜌 and the relative risk aversion coefficient is 𝜃. In this case, the dynamic equations for capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 concerning time 𝑡 are expressed as equations (1) and (2). ?̇? (𝑡) = 𝑓(𝑘(𝑡)) − 𝑐(𝑡) − (𝛿 + 𝜆 + 𝜅)𝑘(𝑡). (1)
?̇? (𝑡) 𝑐(𝑡) =
𝑓 ′(𝑘(𝑡)) − 𝛿 − 𝜌 − 𝜃𝜅
𝜃 . (2)
This study uses the Cobb–Douglas function 𝑓(𝑘(𝑡)) = 𝑘(𝑡)𝛼 as the production function (Romer, 2019: 13; Nakata, 2011: 121) and setting 𝜆 = 𝜅 = 0 because the labour and knowledge growth rates are not covered. Then, the dynamic equations can be
rewritten as equations (3) and (4). ?̇? (𝑡) = 𝑘(𝑡)𝛼 − 𝑐(𝑡) − 𝛿𝑘(𝑡). (3)
?̇? (𝑡) = 𝑐(𝑡)
𝛼𝑘(𝑡)𝛼−1 − 𝛿 − 𝜌
𝜃 . (4)
These dynamic equations are known to converge at the saddle point (Romer, 2019: 62– 65; Nakata, 2011: 122). If we solve the equations with the left-hand side of (3) and (4) set to zero, the capital 𝑘∗ and consumption 𝑐∗ at the saddle point can be expressed as equations (5) and (6). 𝑘∗ = (
𝛿 + 𝜌
𝛼 )
1 𝛼−1
. (5)
𝑐∗ = 𝑘∗𝛼 − 𝛿𝑘 ∗ . (6)
We now assume the case where the discount rate changes (Romer, 2019: 67–69). Let
𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 be the discount rate before the change and 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 be the discount rate after the change. Then, using equations (5) and (6), the saddle points 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ and 𝑐𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ before the change are expressed as equations (7) and (8); the saddle points 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ and 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ are expressed as equations (9) and (10) after the change. 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷
∗ = ( 𝛿 + 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷
𝛼 )
1 𝛼−1
. (7)
𝑐𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ = 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ 𝛼 − 𝛿𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ . (8)
𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊
∗ = ( 𝛿 + 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊
𝛼 )
1 𝛼−1
. (9)
𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ = 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ 𝛼 − 𝛿𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ . (10)
When the discount rate changes from 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 to 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊, capital 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ initially maintains the same value because it cannot change discontinuously and consumption 𝑐𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ jumps discontinuously (Romer, 2019: 67–69). At this time, capital 𝑘𝐴 and consumption 𝑐𝐴 are expressed as equations (11)–(14) (Romer, 2019: 69–71). 𝑘𝐴 = 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ . (11)
𝑐𝐴 = 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊
∗ + 𝑓″(𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ )𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗
𝜃𝜇 (𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷 ∗ − 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ ). (12)
𝑓″(𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ ) = 𝛼(𝛼 − 1)𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ 𝛼−2. (13)
𝜇 =
𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 − √𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 2 − 4𝑓″(𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ )𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ 𝜃⁄
2 . (14)
After the change, capital 𝑘𝐴 and consumption 𝑐𝐴 converge along an adjustment path toward the new saddle points 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ and 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ (Romer, 2019: 69–71). Along this adjustment path, the changes in capital 𝑘𝐴𝐷𝐽(𝑡) and consumption 𝑐𝐴𝐷𝐽(𝑡) are represented by the approximate equations (15) and (16). 𝑘𝐴𝐷𝐽 (𝑡) = 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ + 𝑒𝜇𝑡(𝑘𝐴 − 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ ). (15)
𝑐𝐴𝐷𝐽(𝑡) = 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ + 𝑒𝜇𝑡(𝑐𝐴 − 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊 ∗ ). (16) utility model We next refer to the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans infinite-horizon model as the basic utility
model (Romer, 2019: 52–55; Nakata, 2011: 40–44). The infinite-horizon utility function 𝑈 is expressed as equation (17). Here, the discount rate is 𝜌, the instantaneous utility is 𝑢(𝑐(𝑡)) and the instantaneous utility, 𝑢(𝑐(𝑡)) , is 𝑐(𝑡)1−𝜃 (1 − 𝜃)⁄ with constant relative risk aversion. 𝑈 = ∫ 𝑒−𝜌𝑡𝑢(𝑐(𝑡))𝑑𝑡
∞
𝑡 = 0
= ∫ 𝑒−𝜌𝑡 𝑐(𝑡)1−𝜃
1 − 𝜃 𝑑𝑡. ∞
𝑡 = 0
(17)
For a measure of time preference based on the quasi-hyperbolic form, the utility function 𝑈 is expressed as equation (18). Here, patience is 𝑢0 , the current bias is 𝛽𝑝 and the discount rate is 𝜙 (Wang et al., 2016). Rewriting 𝜙𝑡 as an exponential function with 𝑒 as the base, − ln(1 𝜙⁄ ) 𝑡 as the exponent and setting 𝑢0 = 0 and 𝛽𝑝 = 1 for simplicity, equation (18) coincides with (17). 𝑈 = 𝑢0 + ∫ 𝛽𝑝𝜙
𝑡𝑢(𝑐(𝑡))𝑑𝑡 ∞
𝑡 = 0
= 𝑢0 + 𝛽𝑝 ∫ 𝑒 − ln(
1 𝜙 )𝑡 𝑢(𝑐(𝑡))𝑑𝑡

𝑡 = 0
. (18)
We now assume that the discount rate changes 𝑛 times in the middle of an infinite horizon. Let the time of change be 𝑡1, 𝑡2, ⋯ , 𝑡𝑛 and the discount rate be 𝜌0 , 𝜌1 , ⋯ , 𝜌𝑛. Then, the utility function, 𝑈, is expressed as equation (19). 𝑈 = ∫ 𝑒−𝜌0𝑡

The interaction model of time preference
We refer to the econophysics approach in modelling interactions with others and referencing social norms regarding time preferences. In econophysics (Chatterjee &
Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK, 2010), two agents are randomly selected from a large number of agents, the exchange of assets between them is modelled and the
repeated selection of two agents is used to simulate various wealth distributions. Thus, we model the change in time preference due to the interaction between agents 𝑖 and 𝑗. Let the discount rates of both agents at time 𝑡 be 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 (𝑡); both change to 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) due to their interaction in equations (20) and (21), respectively. 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 (𝑡) (1 − 𝜀𝑘
𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) − 𝑘𝑖 (𝑡)
𝑘𝑖 (𝑡) + 𝜀𝑐
𝛽𝑐 𝑐𝑗 (𝑡) − 𝑐𝑖 (𝑡)
𝑐𝑖 (𝑡)
+ 𝜀𝜌 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 − 𝜌𝑖 (𝑡)
𝜌𝑖 (𝑡) ). (20)
𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 (𝑡) (1 − 𝜀𝑘
𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑖 (𝑡) − 𝑘𝑗 (𝑡)
𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝜀𝑐
𝛽𝑐𝑐𝑖 (𝑡) − 𝑐𝑗 (𝑡)
𝑐𝑗 (𝑡)
+ 𝜀𝜌 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 − 𝜌𝑗 (𝑡)
𝜌𝑗 (𝑡) ). (21)
The second and third terms in the brackets on the right-hand side of equations (20) and (21) represent the interaction based on the intercomparison of capital 𝑘𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) and consumption 𝑐𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝑗 (𝑡) (t), respectively, because the time preference is considered to be influenced by both capital (future consumption) and current consumption (Romer, 2019: 370–371). 𝛽𝑘 ≥ 1 and 𝛽𝑐 ≥ 1 are parameters that represent the so-called ‘the grass is greener on the other side’ psychological bias. The existence of this psychological bias is well known in neuroscience (Boorman et al.,
2009; Noritake et al., 2018); however, its effects on capital and consumption remain unexamined; therefore, we formulate them here as in equations (20) and (21). Here, 0 ≤ 𝜀𝑘 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ 𝜀𝑐 ≤ 1 are the parameters for the strength of the interaction. Equation (20) explains that if 𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) > 𝑘𝑖 (𝑡) when others’ capital appears larger, the discount rate 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡) becomes smaller than 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 (𝑡) (reducing consumption). Furthermore, if 𝛽𝑐𝑐𝑗 (𝑡) > 𝑐𝑖 (𝑡) when others’ consumption appears larger, 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡) becomes larger than 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 (𝑡) (increasing consumption). The fourth term represents the reference to the social normative discount rate, 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 , where 0 ≤ 𝜀𝜌 ≤ 1 is a parameter indicating the strength of the reference. Social norms include secular morality, Buddhist teachings and Islamic law. If 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝑐 = 0 and 𝜀𝜌 = 1 , then 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 . Equation (20) explains that if
𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑖 (𝑡) > 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 when the current discount rate is larger than the normative discount rate, then 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑖 (𝑡) becomes smaller than 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑖 (𝑡) (reducing consumption). In other words, the normative discount rate 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 works in a suppressive manner; however, if 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 is large (when the whole society is ephemeral), 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡) will become larger (increasing consumption). Figure 1 shows the computational flow for time preference interaction. First, in Step I, the number of agents (𝑁), the time increment (∆𝑡) of the computation, the period (𝑡𝑝) for the interaction and the maximum time (𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) for the computation are set as initial settings. Furthermore, the initial discount rate (𝜌0), the initial utility (𝑈0), the exponent (𝛼) of the production function, the capital depletion rate (𝛿) and the coefficient of relative risk aversion (𝜃) are set as initial settings for all agents. Although not shown in Figure 1, parameters 𝛽𝑘 , 𝛽𝑐, 𝜀𝑘 , 𝜀𝑐 and 𝜀𝜌 in equations (20) and (21) are also set together. In Step II, we use the initial values and equations (5) and (6) and calculate the capital (𝑘0 ∗) and consumption (𝑐0 ∗) for all agents at time 𝑡 = 0. In Step III, we advance time 𝑡 to 𝑡 + 𝛥𝑡. In Step IV, we calculate the surplus 𝑀𝑜𝑑(𝑡 𝑡𝑝⁄ ) of time 𝑡 and divided by 𝑡𝑝. If it is 0, we return to Step V; if the value is not 0, we proceed to Step IX. In Step V, we randomly select two agents 𝑖 and 𝑗 (𝑖 ≠ 𝑗, 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, 2, ⋯ , 𝑁) among 𝑁
agents. In Step VI, using equations (20) and (21), we change the discount rates 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 (𝑡) of agents 𝑖 and 𝑗 to 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡), respectively. In Step VII, using equations (11) and (12), we change the capital 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 (𝑡) and consumption 𝑐𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 (𝑡) for agent 𝑖 and 𝑘𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 (𝑡) for 𝑗 to 𝑘𝐴𝑖 (𝑡) , 𝑐𝐴𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑘𝐴𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝐴𝑗 (𝑡), respectively. In Step VIII, using equations (15) and (16), we
set the adjustment paths 𝑘𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑐𝐴𝐷𝐽 𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑘𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑗 (𝑡) toward the new
saddle points 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑘𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) , which are calculated using equations (9) and (10). After that, as time 𝑡 advances, 𝑘𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑐𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝑗 (𝑡) proceed along the adjustment path. In Step IX, which follows from Step IV or VIII, we calculate the increment of utility 𝑈𝑖 corresponding to time increment ∆𝑡 for each agent 𝑖 ( 𝑖 = 1, 2, ⋯ , 𝑁 ) based on equations (17) or (19); we use the discount rate 𝜌𝑖 (𝑡) and instantaneous utility
𝑐𝑖 (𝑡) 1−𝜃 (1 − 𝜃)⁄ at time 𝑡. In Step X, if time 𝑡 has reached 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥, we proceed to Step XI; otherwise, we return to Step III. In Step XI, we calculate the utility from time 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 to infinite horizon ∞ using the discount rate 𝜌𝑖 (𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) at time 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥, added to utility 𝑈𝑖 and the process ends. If the discount rate is changed again by returning to Step III and proceeding from IV to VI, the new saddle point is recalculated and 𝑘𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑐𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑘𝑗 (𝑡) and 𝑐𝑗 (𝑡) proceed along the new adjustment path. results First, we initialize the common parameters to be used in the calculations. The number of agents is set to 𝑁 = 1,000 (sufficient to compute the wealth distribution and Gini index). The time increment is ∆𝑡 = 1 (24 × 365)⁄ (hour), the interaction period is 𝑡𝑝 = 1 365⁄ (day) and the maximum computation time is 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 10 (years). These values are relative; therefore, they could be read as 10 hours, 10 days and 100 years, respectively. Over 10 years, 7,300 people (10 × 365 × 2) would change their behaviour, each receiving an average of 0.73 interactions per year. The initial discount rate is set to 𝜌0 = ln(1 𝜙⁄ ) = 0.223 using the value 𝜙~0.8 from the literature (Wang et al., 2016) and equation (18). The normative discount rate is set to 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 = 0.2, which is smaller than the initial value and the initial utility is set to 𝑈0 = 0. We set the exponent 𝛼 and capital depletion rate 𝛿 of the production function to 𝛼 = 0.5 and 𝛿 = 0.1 respectively, based on the values used in the literature (Romer, 2019: 27, 72; Nakata, 2011: 9, 90, 94; Hasumi, 2020: 25–26, 71). For the coefficient of relative risk aversion (𝜃), a wide variety of values have been reported depending on the measurement method and subject (Hartog et al., 2002; Itou, 2008; Elminejada et al., 2022); however, here it is set to 𝜃 = 0.5. Initial capital and consumption are calculated as 𝑘0 = 2.39 and 𝑐0 = 1.31 using equations (5) and (6), respectively. We used the following 12 calculations for the discount rate, the others’ interaction parameters (𝜀𝑘 , 𝜀𝑐) and the social norm reference parameter (𝜀𝜌): (i) three cases of 𝜀𝑘 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 (𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0); (ii) three cases of 𝜀𝑐 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 (𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0); (iii) three cases where the setting in (i) changes to 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1; and (iv) three cases where the setting in (ii) is changed to 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1. Primarily, the strength of the interaction is expressed in terms of 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐 and the constant 𝛽𝑘 = 𝛽𝑐 = 1.1 are set for the psychological bias parameter. Figure 2 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for capital interactions 𝜀𝑘 = 0.1, 𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0 and 𝛽𝑘 = 1.1. Figure 2A plots the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) at time 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 10 for agent number #, while Figure 2B shows the frequency distribution of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). Similarly, Figures 2C
and 2D show the distribution of capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) , while 2E and 2F show the consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 2G and 2H show the utility 𝑈 over an infinite horizon. Figure 2B shows that comparing capital with others, the mean of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) decreases from the initial 𝜌0 = 0.223 to 0.207 (future-oriented). Accordingly, Figures 2D and 2F show that the mean of capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) increase from initial 𝑘0 = 2.39 and 𝑐0 = 1.31 to 2.65 and 1.36, respectively. The skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) are, respectively, 0.44 and 3.30, −0.33 and 3.11 for 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), −0.40 and 3.23 for 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and −1.27 and 5.96 for 𝑈. Except for 𝑈, the others are generally normal distributions. Figure 3 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for 𝜀𝑘 = 0.1 and 𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0, as in Figure 2. Figure 3A plots the discount rate 𝜌 for time 𝑡 concerning agent #1 and Figure 3B is an enlarged part of 3A. Similarly, Figures 3C and 3D show the capital 𝑘 and 3E and 3F show the consumption 𝑐 . Figures 3G and 3H are the values of the interval integral of utility 𝑈 from time 0 to 𝑡. Note that the value of utility 𝑈 converges to a constant value at infinite horizon ∞. Figure 3A shows that agent #1 received nine interactions. In Figure 3B, the discount rate 𝜌 decreases around time 𝑡 = 7.0 and accordingly, Figure 3F shows that the consumption 𝑐 decreases discontinuously. Thereafter, Figures 3D and 3F indicate that capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle point. At the new saddle point, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 are higher than before the decrease in discount rate 𝜌 (Romer, 2019: 67–69). In other words, comparing capital with others suppresses the agent’s consumption once; however, it leads to a higher level
of economic behaviour in the future. Figure 3H shows a slight inflexion in the curve of utility 𝑈 due to the change in the discount rate 𝜌. Figure 4 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for consumption interactions 𝜀𝑐 = 0.1, 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0 and 𝛽𝑐 = 1.1. Figure 4A plots the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) for agent number # and Figure 4B shows the frequency distribution of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). Similarly, Figures 4C and 4D show the capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 4E and 4F show the consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 4G and 4H show the utility 𝑈. By comparison of consumption with others, in Figure 4B, the mean of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) increases from the initial 𝜌0 = 0.223 to 0.240 (future
despised). Accordingly, Figures 4D and 4F show that the mean of capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) decrease from initial 𝑘0 = 2.39 and 𝑐0 = 1.31 to 2.17 and 1.25, respectively. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 2. The skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) are 1.00 and 4.59, respectively, −0.73 and 3.72 for 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) , −0.85 and 4.08 for 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and −1.42 and 5.99 for 𝑈 . These values are all larger than that in Figure 2, indicating that consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 distorts the shape of the distribution more than capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 . Figure 5 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for 𝜀𝑐 = 0.1 and 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0, as in Figure 4. Figure 5A plots the discount rate 𝜌 for time 𝑡 concerning agent #1 and Figure 5B is an enlarged part of 5A. Similarly, Figures 5C and 5D show the capital 𝑘 and 5E and 5F show the consumption 𝑐 . Figures 5G and 5H are the values of the interval integral of utility 𝑈 from time 0 to 𝑡. Figure 5A shows that agent #1 received four interactions. In Figure 5B, the discount rate 𝜌 increases around time 𝑡 = 7.8. Accordingly, Figure 5F shows that the consumption 𝑐 once increases discontinuously. After that, as in Figures 5D and 5F, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle point. At the new saddle point, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 are lower than before the increase in discount rate 𝜌. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 3. The comparison of
consumption with others induces the agent’s consumption once; however, it leads to a lower level of economic behaviour in the future. Figure 5H shows a slight inflexion in the curve of utility 𝑈 due to the change in the discount rate 𝜌. Figures 6A–6D show the results of calculating the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and utility 𝑈 for the interaction parameter 𝜀𝑘 and the reference parameter 𝜀𝜌. CV is the square root of the variance divided by the mean value and it measures inequality. The horizontal axis is 𝜀𝑘 , the first vertical axis is the mean and the second is the CV. The mean for 𝜀𝜌 = 0 is shown in navy and the CV in light navy and the mean for 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1 in green and the CV in light green. Similarly, Figures 6E–6H show the calculation results for the interaction parameter 𝜀𝑐. Figures 6A–6D show that the capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 works in the direction of lowering the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), which raises capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and utility 𝑈. The values of CV are generally small, as
is the effect of the social norm reference 𝜀𝜌. Comparing the CV of 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and the CV of 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) shows that the former is larger. In Figures 6E–6H, the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 raises the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) more than the capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 , which in turn lowers capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and utility 𝑈. Compared to 𝜀𝑘 , 𝜀𝑐 has a generally more significant impact on CV. The impact on the CV of capital is larger than that of consumption and utility. The social norm illumination 𝜀𝜌 reduces the increase in the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and increases capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and utility 𝑈. For 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3 and 𝜀𝜌 = 0, the CV of 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) reaches 0.225 for the mean 1.82, corresponding to an increase in the Gini index of 0.14 when calculated from the distribution of 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). When 𝜀𝜌 = 0 changes to 0.1, the CV drops to 0.09 𝑎𝑛𝑑 the incremental Gini index falls to 0.05 . These results suggest that higher discount rates create capital (wealth) inequality and that social
norms that discourage waste are essential. Figure 7 plots capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) for discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). Figures 7A and 7B show the capital interactions 𝜀𝑘 = 0.1 and 𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0. Figures 7C and 7D show the case where the settings of 7A and 7B change to 𝜀𝑘 = 0.3. Figures 7E and 7F show the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 = 0.1 and 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0. Figures 7G and 7H show the case where the settings of 7E and 7F are changed to 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3. The plots of 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) in Figures 7A, 7C, 7E and 7G generally ride on the curve represented by equation (5). Furthermore, the plots of 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) in Figures 7B, 7D, 7F and 7H generally ride on the curve represented by equation (6) (see graph of 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗ at the saddle point for 𝜌 in Figure 11A). In Figures 7A–7D, the plots are scattered on
the lower side of the curve and in Figures 7E–7H, the plots are scattered on the upper side of the curve. In the former, 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) decreases with 𝜀𝑘 , showing the intermediate steps until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 become larger. In the latter, 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) increases with 𝜀𝑐, showing the intermediate steps until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 become smaller. Comparing Figures 7G and 7H with Figures 7C and 7D, the impact of 𝜀𝑐 on the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) is more significant than that of 𝜀𝑘 . The curved shape is more clearly visible in Figure 7G and 7H than in Figure 7C and 7D because the range of the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) is wider due to 𝜀𝑐 than due to 𝜀𝑘 . Figure 8 plots utility 𝑈 over an infinite horizon against capital 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and consumption 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). Figures 8A and 8B show the capital interactions 𝜀𝑘 = 0.1 and 𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0. Figures 8B and 8C show the case where the settings of 8A and 8B change to 𝜀𝑘 = 0.3 and Figures 8E and 8F show the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 =
0.1 and 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0. Figures 8G and 8H show the case where the settings of 8E and
8F change to 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3. Comparing Figures 8C and 8D with Figures 8A and 8B shows that as the capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 increases, utility 𝑈 increases overall and its distribution widens. Comparing Figures 8G and 8H with Figures 8E and 8F shows that as the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 increases, utility 𝑈 decreases overall and the shape of its distribution changes. Comparing Figures 8A–8D and Figures 8E–8H reveals difference in the tendency of 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐 to affect the distribution of utility 𝑈. For 𝜀𝑘 , the distribution moves toward the upper right, where 𝑈 and 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) or 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) become larger. In contrast, for 𝜀𝑐, the distribution once moves toward the upper left, where 𝑈 increases and 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) or 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) decreases while 𝜀𝑐 is small. It then moves toward the lower left, where 𝑈 and 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) or 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) decrease as 𝜀𝑐 becomes large. Figures 9A and 9B are plots of 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) versus 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) versus 𝑈 for 𝜀𝑘 = 0.3 and 𝜀𝑐 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0, respectively. Figure 9A is a repeat of 7C and 9B is a repeat of 8D. Similarly, Figures 9C and 9D are for 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3 and 𝜀𝑘 = 𝜀𝜌 = 0 and are repeats of Figures 7G and 8H, respectively. Figures 9E and 9D show when the settings of either 𝜀𝑘 = 0.3 or 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3 are randomly chosen on the interaction occasion every period 𝑡𝑝. Figures 9G and 9H are the cases where the settings of Figures 9E and 9D change from 𝜀𝜌 = 0 to 0.1 and a reference to the social norm is added. The shape of Figure 9E is intermediate between 9A and 9C and the shape of Figure 9F is intermediate between 9B and 9D. The means of 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 𝑈 in Figures 9E and 9F are intermediate between those values in Figures 9A–9D (roughly
the average of the values shown in 9A–9D). Although not shown in Figure 9, the CVs are intermediate but larger than the average values in 9A–9D. Figures 9G and 9H change to 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1 and also have intermediate shapes and values like 9E and 9F; however, the reference to social norms results in a smaller mean for 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and larger means for 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 𝑈 compared to 9E and 9F. Although not shown in Figure 9, all CVs for 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1 are smaller than that for 𝜀𝜌 = 0. discussion We formulated changes in the discount rate (time preference) based on the
intercomparison of capital or consumption among agents and reference to social norms by connecting the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model of dynamic macroeconomics and
the agent interaction model of microeconomics. This approach revealed that interactions with others affect the discount rate and produce inequality in capital (wealth) and utility
and that references to social norms reduce changes in the discount rate and inequality. Specifically, when the interaction parameter with others 𝜀𝑐 = 0.3 in Figure 6, the coefficient of variation increases to 0.225 and the Gini index increases by 0.14 as the discount rate 𝜌 changes. In this case, when the social norm reference parameter 𝜀𝜌 =
0.1, the coefficient of variation drops to 0.09 and the increment of the Gini index falls
to 0.05. A cohort study (Epper et al., 2020) divides participant groups into tertiles according to time preference (patience), showing that the wealth difference between the top and
bottom time preference groups is in the 7–8 percentile. The difference between the top and bottom tertile is roughly 2σ (twice the standard deviation); thus, the wealth
difference translates into a coefficient of variation of about 4%, which corresponds approximately to cases 𝜀𝑘~0.3 or 𝜀𝑐~0.1 in Figure 6. This result can be interpreted as follows: if every individual had the same time preference at birth, as they grow up, their time preferences would gradually diverge due to their interactions with others,
resulting in wealth inequality. A cross-cultural study on time preference (Reiger et al., 2021) calculates universal time
preference (UTP) for 117 countries by integrating various survey data, including discount rate data from reference (Wang et al. 2016). A larger UTP means a smaller
discount rate. Figure 10 uses UTP data and World Bank Gini index data to UTP and the Gini index for 104 countries (The World Bank). UTP and the Gini index have a weak
correlation, although considerable variation occurs among countries due to economic conditions and cultural differences. The regression line indicates that the difference in
the Gini index relative to the maximum difference in UTP is about 0.15, which corresponds to the case 𝜀𝑐~0.3 in Figure 6. Social norms, including rules and culture, are fostered by mutual recognition (Heath, 2008); thus, we can infer that at least part of
the difference in the Gini index is caused by differences in time preference due to interaction with others. The red dots in Figure 10 indicate Islamic states, which are
roughly below the regression line. This finding may be because Islamic states have laws (Sharia) that discourage waste compared to capitalist states. Comparing Figures 6B and 6C and Figures 6F and 6G shows that the impact of the coefficient of variation of capital 𝑘 from its interaction with others, 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐, is larger than that of consumption 𝑐. This finding is explained in Figure 11. Figure 11A graphs capital 𝑘∗ and consumption 𝑐∗ at the saddle point concerning the discount rate 𝜌 using equations (5) and (6); 11B is a graph depicting the derivative 𝑘∗′ of 𝑘∗ and the derivative 𝑐∗′ of 𝑐∗ for 𝜌. Figure 11B shows that the absolute value of 𝑘∗′ is larger than the absolute value of 𝑐∗′; therefore, the impact of 𝑘 from a change in 𝜌 is larger than that of 𝑐. This outcome suggests that interaction with others has a more significant impact on capital (wealth) inequality than consumption. The impact of the CV of utility 𝑈 from 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐 is even smaller than that of 𝑘 and 𝑐 because the impact of 𝑐 is smaller than that of 𝑘, 𝑈 is a function of 𝑐 and the integral value 𝑈
from time 𝑡 = 0 is less sensitive than the instantaneous value of 𝑘 and 𝑐. This result is reflected in the slight inflexion of the curve in Figures 3G and 5G. Figures 6D and 6H show that the CV of 𝑈 is about 8%, e.g. the CV of the well-being measured value in the literature (Pontin et al., 2013) is 23%. Among the various constituent factors of
well-being, utility based on consumption accounts for about 1/3 of well-being; therefore, the value of the CV of 𝑈 itself is not small. Comparing the left and right pairs in Figure 6, such as 6A and 6E, 6B and 6F and 6C and 6G, the impact of 𝜀𝑐 on the mean and coefficient of variation of 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) , 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 𝑈 is larger than that of 𝜀𝑘 because equations (20) and (21) represent interactions. Looking at these, 𝜀𝑐 works in the direction of increasing the discount rate 𝜌 and 𝜀𝑘 decreases it. 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 is expressed as the multiplication of 𝜀𝑐 and 𝜀𝑘 concerning the original 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 ; therefore, as the interaction is repeated, the difference between 𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 and 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 (𝜌𝑁𝐸𝑊 − 𝜌𝑂𝐿𝐷 ) gradually increases for 𝜀𝑐 and decreases for 𝜀𝑘 , i.e. the impact of 𝜀𝑐 on the change in 𝜌 is larger than that of 𝜀𝑘 . This finding suggests that consumption interactions impact capital (wealth) inequality more than capital interactions. Figure 6 shows the impacts of the social norm reference 𝜀𝜌 on 𝜌(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑘(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), 𝑐(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥) and 𝑈 are larger on the 𝜀𝑐 side and smaller on the 𝜀𝑘 side because, as mentioned in the above paragraph, the change in 𝜌 is larger for 𝜀𝑐 than for 𝜀𝑘 . Therefore, the suppression effect of the change in 𝜌 by 𝜀𝜌 is more likely to appear. Furthermore, the slight change in 𝜌 due to 𝜀𝑘 means that the value of 𝜌 is near the initial value 𝜌0 = 0.223 and close to the normative discount rate 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 = 0.2 because this makes the (𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 − 𝜌) 𝜌⁄ term in equations (20) and (21) smaller. These findings suggest that social norms are more effective in reducing the impact of consumption interactions on inequality than capital interactions. Note that if the 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 setting is too large (i.e. if the social norm is made too loose), 𝜌 will be larger and 𝑘 and 𝑐 will be smaller for 𝜀𝜌 = 0.1 than for 𝜀𝜌 = 0; this is shown in the case of 𝜀𝑘 = 0.3 in Figures 6A–6D. Conversely, a small setting of 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 reduces waste, but an excessive setting may lead to stinginess. Therefore, the setting of 𝜌𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 should be set between stinginess and wastefulness. Greek philosophy, Buddhism and Islamic law
also teach this. The difference in the shape of the distribution of utility 𝑈 between Figures 8A–8D and
Figures 8E–8H can be interpreted as follows. In Figures 8A–8D, the new saddle points, 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗, are larger because the capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 decreases the discount rate 𝜌 and utility 𝑈 increases accordingly, i.e. it has a vector in the upper right direction of the graph. Nonetheless, since a decrease in 𝜌 temporarily lowers consumption 𝑐, 𝑈, a function of 𝑐, goes down; therefore, it has a vector in the lower direction of the graph. Thus, the distribution of Figures 8A–8D will have superimposed vectors in the upper
right and lower directions. Conversely, in Figures 8E–8H, the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 increases 𝜌, 𝑘 ∗, 𝑐∗ and 𝑈 decrease and those distributions have vectors in the lower left direction of the graph; however, since an increase in 𝜌 temporarily raises consumption 𝑐, 𝑈, a function of 𝑐, increases and has a vector in the upper direction of
the graph. Thus, the distribution of Figures 8E–8H will have superimposed vectors in the lower left and upper directions. Previous studies have examined income and
well-being relationships (Killingsworth, 2023); in the future, it might be fruitful to relate this to the graph of capital 𝑘 and utility 𝑈 in Figure 8. Figure 9E, with randomly selected capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 and consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐, has a distribution shape intermediate between Figures 9A and 9C and a roughly mean intermediate value between them. Figure 9F also has a shape intermediate between Figures 9B and 9D and a roughly mean intermediate value between them. These indicate that the impacts of 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐 on the discount rate 𝜌 , capital 𝑘 ,
consumption 𝑐 and utility 𝑈 can be treated as linear independence. The linearity of the graph of means in Figure 6 also indicates that the impacts of 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐 on 𝜌, 𝑘, 𝑐 and 𝑈 can be extrapolated. These are useful in examining various combinations of 𝜀𝑘 and 𝜀𝑐. If we can understand whether individuals value capital or consumption in their interactions with others, we can approximate the impact on capital (wealth) and consumption. Although the coefficient of variation is an intermediate value, it is not an
average value and cannot be treated as linear independence; therefore, it must be recalculated again when examining capital (wealth) and utility inequality. The distribution shapes in Figures 2 and 4 show that the capital interaction 𝜀𝑘 and the consumption interaction 𝜀𝑐 generate distributions, i.e. inequalities, from initial uniform values; however, they are not power distributions, e.g. Pareto distribution (Newman, 2005), commonly found in wealth and income distributions. In other words, it is
reasonable to consider that inequalities brought by changes in time preference (discount rate) based on interactions with others are part of the overall inequality. In contrast,
econophysics studies various distributions, such as power and gamma distributions, by modelling asset exchange among agents based on the analogy of kinetic energy
exchange (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK 2010); however, since these studies are physical analogies, they do not provide the same insight into
capital, consumption and utility dynamics as macroeconomics. To study inequality due to factors other than time preference and macroeconomic dynamics, developing an
approach that connects the microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic models would be helpful, as presented in this study. This approach would lead to
generalizations beyond the findings of this study. Based on this study, instead of the interaction model of time preference, it is possible to model the exchange of products
(market) related to capital (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010) and to model the interest and debt on capital, the production by joint ventures that
combine capital, the redistribution and mutual aid of capital (Kato & Hiroi, 2021; Kato, 2022; Kato, 2023). conclusion This study presented a new model that connects the interaction effects of
intercomparisons between individuals and others and references to social norms on time preferences to a dynamic macroeconomic model. Through this, we estimated the impact
of changes in time preference (discount rate) on capital, consumption and utility and the inequality (coefficient of variation, Gini index) resulting from these changes. The new
findings are that (i) interactions with others significantly impact capital (wealth) inequality more than consumption. (ii) Among interactions with others,
intercomparisons of consumption have a more significant impact on capital inequality and (iii) social norms effectively reduce the impact of consumption on inequality. These
findings reaffirm the importance of social norms against waste. Our supporting evidence indicates that the quantitative impact of the time preference interaction on wealth
inequality corresponds to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies and that it has no small impact on utility inequality. Previous studies have shown that multiple psychological motivations and factors, as well as mutual recognition and shared expectations of social groups, are essential for
time preference; however, no specific mathematical model exists for these factors and time preference. Therefore, we formulated the interactions on time preferences as
relative capital, consumption and social norm comparisons.
