Ethereum 2.0, as the preeminent smart contract blockchain platform, guarantees the precise execution of applications without third-party intervention. At its core, this system leverages the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which utilizes a stochastic process to select validators for block proposal and validation, consequently rewarding them for their contributions. However, the implementation of blockchain technology often diverges from its central tenet of decentralized consensus, presenting significant analytical challenges. Our study collects consensus reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain and conducts a comprehensive analysis of reward distribution and evolution, categorizing them into attestation, proposer and sync committee rewards. To evaluate the degree of decentralization in PoS Ethereum, we apply several inequality indices, including the Shannon entropy, the Gini Index, the Nakamoto Coefficient, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Our comprehensive dataset is publicly available on Harvard Dataverse, and our analytical methodologies are accessible via GitHub, promoting open-access research. Additionally, we provide insights on utilizing our data for future investigations focused on assessing, augmenting, and refining the decentralization, security, and efficiency of blockchain systems. 1 Background & Summary Blockchain technology, designed to catalyze a shift towards a decentralized and equitable digital ecosystem, sets the stage for significant advancements like Ethereum 2.0. The introduction of Ethereum 2.0 signifies a transformative development in the realm of blockchain technology, marking a departure from the established Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.1, 2 This transition, which took place on September 15, 2022, not only aims to mitigate the environmental and scalability challenges inherent in PoW but also ushers in a novel approach to reward distribution that prioritizes staking Ether over computational exertion. Previous studies have underscored significant variations in reward distribution among different blockchain networks, such as Cardano,3 and Bitcoin,4, 5 sparking debates over the potential concentration of wealth and authority. 6–10 Against this backdrop, the PoS iteration of Ethereum offers an invaluable opportunity to investigate whether this paradigm shift could lead to a more equitable allocation of rewards, challenging the centralization trends noted in PoW frameworks. Notwithstanding the significance of this investigation, there is a noticeable scarcity of detailed, accessible data on reward distribution within the PoS domain of Ethereum. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by formulating a comprehensive methodology for accruing reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain, with the goal of evaluating the degree of decentralization in this emergent ecosystem. By implementing Ethereum Erigon and Teku nodes to harvest data from the Beacon chain and employing a variety of inequality indices to scrutinize the decentralization of reward allocation, our research sheds light on the distribution patterns of rewards among validators in Ethereum 2.0, suggesting a progression towards a more decentralized reward framework.

Subsequently, after synchronizing the block data, we employed the Web3.py Python library and the API of the Teku node to collect reward data. The rewards are categorized into three main types: proposer reward, attestation reward, and sync committee reward. Notably, the attestation reward is updated per epoch. Each epoch can encompass hundreds of thousands of validators, leading to a substantial volume of data. We collected data for a duration of two months after the Ethereum PoS transition, resulting in a total dataset size of 173.8 GB, with attestation reward data constituting 167 GB.

2. Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) Extraction: MEV is associated with the value that validators can extract from the ordering and inclusion of transactions within newly created blocks.13 Validators have the option to optimize this process by delegating such responsibilities to specialized agents within the ecosystem, such as Flashbots.14
Our research focus revolves around a comprehensive examination of the reward mechanisms inherent to the consensus layer of the Beacon chain. Our primary objective is to illuminate its pivotal role in nurturing active participation and ensuring the long-term stability of the Ethereum network. It is of utmost importance to underscore that the rewards disbursed at the Beacon chain layer significantly contribute to the expansion of the monetary supply, denominated in Ether, within the system. Validators, entities holding stakes of 32 Ether within the Beacon chain contract4, receive rewards for engaging in three distinct roles within the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus process: attestors, block proposers, and members of the sync committee:
1. Attestor are entitled to rewards for attesting to the following:5
(a) Source: Voting in favor of a source checkpoint for Casper FFG. (b) Target: Voting in favor of a target checkpoint for Casper FFG. (c) Head: Voting for a chain head block for LMD-GHOST. 2. Block Proposers receive rewards in three different categories:
(a) Attestation: Inclusion of attestations in a Beacon chain block. (b) Sync Committee: Incorporation of the sync committee’s output. (c) Whistleblowing: Reporting instances of malicious behavior, which encompasses:
i. Proposer Slashing: Reporting a slashable violation by a proposer. ii. Attestor Slashing: Reporting a slashable violation by an attestor. 3. Sync Committee Members play a pivotal role in assisting light clients in maintaining a synchronized record of Beacon block headers. This categorization establishes the groundwork for an in-depth analysis of Ethereum 2.0’s reward distribution mechanisms within its Beacon chain consensus layer. 4https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa 5Refer to: https://eth2book.info/capella/

Reward dynamics after the Merge 1. Daily reward evolution Figure 2 illustrates a time series of the rewards from September 16 to November 15, 2022. The Figure shows the daily aggregated rewards on the Beacon chain, categorized into three distinct types as defined in Section 2. The blue line in Figure 2 represents the total daily rewards issued on the Beacon chain. Our analysis reveals a consistent trend in the daily issuance of rewards, with a slight upward trajectory over the period. Furthermore, Figure 2 offers insights into the allocation of rewards to validators for their duties. The majority of the rewards are attributed to attestation duties, which are the most frequent tasks performed once per epoch by each validator. This is followed by a significantly smaller portion allocated to proposer duties, and the smallest share comes from the participation in sync committees. 2. Reward Distribution Figure 3 shows histograms of the (daily) aggregated rewards, split into the total reward and the three categories. Through four types of reward distribution, we can obtain fundamental knowledge about Beacon rewards. On average, 1660.1 Ether are generated daily on the Beacon chain. Out of this, 211.42 Ether are allocated to proposers, 1398.78 Ether are allocated to attestors, and 49.9 Ether are allocated to Sync committee members. Furthermore, the distributions expose a low dispersion, which is comparable among each of them. A different picture emerges, when looking at the single validators operating on the Beacon chain. Figure 4 shows the histograms of the income of validators (aggregated over the whole study period). On average, a validator can earn 0.25 Ether per day. A validator is frequently selected as an attestor, and can consistently earn around 0.2 Ether per day. If a validator is chosen as a proposer or a sync committee member, they will receive more rewards. The total reward is centered around a mean value, exhibiting a very low dispersion. This indicates that on a validator level rewards are distributed fairly. This distribution is an indication, that the protocol works as intended, no larger group of validators is able to extract substantially more rewards. Negative values are explained by validator being ”slashed” for not conforming behavior. Finally, the bottom right panel of Figure 4 shows the rewards validators get from being a member on a Sync committee. As the probability of being part of a sync committee is very low, we can see that a large number of validators did not receive any rewards in this category. 3. Validators Growth The left panel of Figure 5 shows how the number of active validators evolved during a period of two months. It steadily increased by around 5 percent during the whole period. The average reward of a single validator, as shown in the right panel of Figure 5, decreased slightly. The decrease in the average daily reward for a validator can be attributed to the slower pace of Ether issuance on the Beacon chain compared to the rate of validator growth. As additional validators are incorporated into the network, the mean reward allocated to each validator is expected to decline progressively. application of inequality metrics to evaluate decentralization Asahi et al. (2021)4 conducted an investigation into the distribution of wealth in eight major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and the Proof-of-Work (PoW) Ethereum. Their findings revealed that, despite the purported emphasis on decentralization within various blockchain networks, wealth distribution remained unequal, with the notable exception of Dash coin. To

assess the decentralization of Ethereum 2.0, we employ several decentralization metrics as outlined in "SoK: Blockchain Decentralization6." These metrics offer valuable insights into the concentration of rewards among different stakeholders. Definitions of the metrics are provided in Section A. The first main observation from Figure 6 is that the distribution of total reward, attestor reward, and proposer reward in Ethereum 2.0 is relatively equal, as indicated by the Gini index being below 0.2 and the HHI index being very small. Additionally, the Shannon Entropy and Nakamoto index show high levels of diversity in rewards. A second crucial finding from the plot is that all metrics remain relatively stable over the chosen period, indicating a consistent level of decentralization over time. Moreover, there is a slight trend towards greater decentralization. The stability of these indices is a positive aspect, as it reaffirms that the design of Ethereum’s PoS mechanism effectively prevents validators from becoming centralized at the validator level. Lastly, the reward distribution among sync committee members is neither equal nor stable, exhibiting periodicity. This discrepancy can be attributed to the mechanism described in Section 2 that the sync committee is only assigned every 256 epochs and comprises 512 validators. 3 data records  3.1 slot and epoch timestamp When querying reward data from the Beacon chain, slot number or epoch number is returned without corresponding timestamps. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of rewards, it is imperative to synchronize the timestamps with each slot and epoch. Fortunately, the time gap between slots and epochs on the Beacon chain is fixed. The smallest time unit on the Beacon chain is a slot, with each slot lasting 12 seconds and every 32 slots forming an epoch. By knowing the start time of the first slot which is 16068240236, the time of each subsequent slot can be deduced. As for the time of each epoch, we take the time of the first slot within each epoch as the epoch’s time. The data structure of slot and epoch timestamp is shown in Table 2. 6https://beaconcha.in/slot/0
5/12 3.2 proposer, attestation and sync committee reward reward The proposer reward data is collected from the Teku node on a per-slot basis. This data consists of various fields, namely: proposer_index, total, attestations, sync_aggregate, proposer_slashings, attester_slashings, slot, and epoch. The total field represents the sum of other reward types, while the epoch is generated based on the slot number referred to in section 3.1. Similarly, the sync committee reward is obtained on a per-slot basis and comprises the fields: validator_index, reward, slot, and epoch. The attestation reward is acquired per epoch and includes the fields: validator_index, head, target, source, total_attestation_reward and epoch. It is worth noting that all rewards are denominated in Gwei, which is equivalent to 10−9 Ether. Thus, for our analysis, we convert the rewards from Gwei to Ether. Furthermore, validators may face penalties, resulting in negative rewards, if they fail to fulfill their duties such as missing a slot or providing invalid proposals or attestations. The structure of each reward data type is presented in Table 3. 3.3 total rewards After obtaining the proposer reward, attestation reward and sync committee reward, we assimilate these three types of rewards into a single table called "total rewards," using the epoch number and validator index as key identifiers. This data set shows the rewards received of each validator who participates validation process of the consensus. This dataset is significantly large, measuring 174G in size, to process and analyze the data effectively, we employ the epoch timestamp outlined in section 3.1. By assigning a timestamp to each epoch, we are able to categorize the dataset on a daily basis. Consequently, we generate the total_reward_by_date table, which is 1.3 G in size. This table provides information on each validator’s proposer reward, attestation reward, and sync committee member reward. To provide a detailed overview of the aggregated rewards, the

comprehensive metadata fields pertaining to rewards by epoch and rewards by date are presented in Table 4. The comprehensive dataset detailing final reward records for Ethereum validators is securely stored and publicly accessible on the Harvard Dataverse.15 This dataset encompasses validator rewards from three distinct sources, presented at various frequencies, along with daily decentralization indices, all formatted in CSV. 4 technical validation To ensure the accuracy of the data, two methods of verification are employed. The first method involves crosschecking the total reward data with the statistics charts available on Beaconscan. Specifically, the "Total Daily Income (Ether)" chart7 provides

7/12 file name variable data type unit insights into the total rewards received by validators in Ether on a daily basis. This data can be compared with the daily total rewards highlighted in our study to ascertain their consistency. Furthermore, for detailed verification of rewards allocated to a specific validator for a given slot or epoch number, the "Income detail history" API method8 proves useful. By entering the validator’s index and the epoch number on this webpage, it is possible to retrieve a breakdown of income components for that validator during the specified epoch. It is pertinent to note that the total incomes depicted include not only beacon chain income but also transaction fees from the execution layer and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) rewards. In Table 5, various income types are listed. For the purposes of this verification, we focus on the beacon chain incomes – attestation reward, proposer reward, and sync reward at epoch 209985 – for validator 480908, aligning with the data we have examined. 5 usage notes  5.1 applicability The reward dataset provided by this study enables a broad spectrum of subsequent analyses and applications. The following usage notes delineate several prospective research trajectories:
1. Time Series Analysis of Rewards: Our dataset facilitates a thorough temporal analysis of reward distribution in Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism and further supports the application of machine learning techniques to blockchain data.16 This analysis is crucial for elucidating temporal patterns, detecting fluctuations over time, and identifying shifts in the decentralization dynamics of the Ethereum PoS system.17
2. Inter-Layer Blockchain Decentralization Correlations: By establishing a decentralization index at the consensus layer of the Ethereum blockchain, our dataset lays the groundwork for probing the correlations between decentralization at the

consensus level and other layers of blockchain architecture, such as hardware, data, network, and application layers18. This approach aligns with the future research directions suggested by Zhang (2023)6 and offers a nuanced understanding of how decentralization metrics at various strata interact and exert mutual influence. 3. Comparative Analysis of Reward Distribution in PoS vs PoW: Utilizing this dataset to conduct a comparative analysis of reward distributions in Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) stages provides vital insights. It facilitates an exploration similar to the causal inference study on transaction fee mechanisms around Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS.1, 19 Such comparative studies are instrumental in discerning the impact of this transition on the ecosystem, particularly concerning aspects of decentralization and distributional fairness.
