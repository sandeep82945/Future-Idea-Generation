The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus had a significant effect on social, economic, and health systems globally. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread worldwide resulting in severe disease, death, and social interference. Countries implemented lockdowns in various regions to limit the spread of the virus. Some of them were successful and some failed. Here, several factors played a vital role in their success. But mostly these factors and their correlations remained unidentified. In this paper, we unlocked those factors that contributed to the success of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the correlations among them. Moreover, this paper proposes several strategies to control any pandemic situation in the future. Here, it explores the relationships among variables, such as population density, number of infected, death, recovered patients, and the success or failure of the lockdown in different regions of the world. The findings suggest a strong correlation among these factors and indicate that the spread of similar kinds of viruses can be reduced in the future by implementing several safety measures. Keywords—COVID-19, Pandemic, Lockdown Success, Correlation, Safety Measures a. data collection Since the desired dataset is new in terms of the objective of this research, the dataset was manually generated by collecting data from this source [26] that contains relevant data that aligned with the research. The created dataset consists of seven features: i) the name of the region, ii) the number of infected, iii) the number of death and iv) the number of recovered patients in that region, v) the area of that region, vi) the population, and vii) the successful launch of lockdown on that region. The collection includes 10,000 data entries up to December 2022 that were collected from 100 different countries. The sample dataset with seven features is presented in Table I. The raw data has also been verified repeatedly to eliminate duplicates and inconsistencies. The success and failure (last attribute) have been chosen based on a study [18] of the lockdown’s success rate in a particular region. b. dataset preprocessing Here, data normalization has been carried out for each numeric attribute using the min-max (min = 0 and max = 1) normalization method to maintain the values within the range of 0 and 1. Since the information was manually collected by the authors and did not contain the density of the regions, the density attribute has been derived from the population and area of each region. Since the success or the failure is not numeric values, the successes have been replaced by 1 and the failures have been replaced by 0. To eliminate biases, the dataset has been generated with an equal distribution of samples (5000 successes and 5000 failures). After adding the
derived attribute, Table II shows the dataset’s actual version. c. correlation coefficient A correlation coefficient summarizes whether a change in one variable is associated with a change in other variables. This statistic is descriptive. Therefore, it presents a summary of a sample of data without drawing any conclusions about the complete population. When it describes the link between two variables, a correlation coefficient is considered a bivariate statistic. However, when it does so among more than two variables, it is considered a multivariate statistic. When a variable increases with the increase of another variable, they are said to be positively correlated, resulting in a positive correlation coefficient. Conversely, if one variable decreases as the other increases, it is referred to as a negative correlation, yielding a negative correlation coefficient. If the
variables are independent and have no relationship, a correlation coefficient of zero is generated. To determine the linear or non-linear relationship between variables, a visually plotted dataset can be employed. While a linear pattern denotes that a straight line is the best match between the data points, a non-linear or curvilinear pattern can take any number of other shapes, including a U-shape or a line with a curve. Fig. 2 depicts an example of positively and negatively correlated variables with linear fitted curves. In this study, various correlation coefficient approaches have been utilized to determine the relationship among the attributes that are mentioned in Sec. III(A). d. categories of correlation coefficient The correlation coefficient is categorized into various types based on the data distribution, the linearity of the relationships among the data, and the measurement level of the variables. This paper utilizes several of these types, and
their details are as follows:
i) Pearson’s r: It is usually referred to as Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient, indicating the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. It is
calculated by the following equation. 𝑟 = 𝑛 ∑ 𝑥𝑦− (∑ 𝑥)(∑ 𝑦)
√[𝑛 ∑ 𝑥2−(∑ 𝑥)2][𝑛 ∑ 𝑦2−(∑ 𝑦)2] (1)
Here,
• r = correlation coefficient between x and y
• x and y = values of X and Y variables
• n = sample size

Rather than using the raw data directly for calculation, the rank correlation coefficient employs the rank of the data from each variable (e.g., from lowest to highest). While the Pearson correlation coefficient measures associations’ linearity, the Spearman correlation coefficient evaluates the monotonicity of correlations. Each variable moves in one direction at the same pace over the whole data range when there is a linear relationship. However, every variable in a monotonic connection changes, but not always at the same pace. It is calculated by the following equation. 𝑟 = 1 − 6 ∑ 𝑑𝑖
2
√(𝑛3−𝑛) (2)
Here,
• r = strength of the rank correlation between variables
• di = the difference between the X-variable rank and the Y-variable rank for each pair of data
• n = sample size
To use this formula, the data is ranked from each variable separately from low value to high value. Then, the differences (di) between the ranks of the variables for each data pair are calculated and provided as the main input for the above
formula. iii) Kendall’s Tau: Kendall’s rank correlation (τ) is a distribution-free test of independence and an assessment of the degree of dependence between two variables. Even if Spearman's rank correlation is sufficient for examining the null hypothesis of independence between two variables, it can occasionally be challenging to understand why the null hypothesis was found to be incorrect. By highlighting the level of reliance between the variables under examination, Kendall’s rank correlation improves on this. The equation
below is used to compute it. τ = 𝑛𝑐−𝑛𝑑

IV. RESULTS AND FINDINGS
This section describes the experimental measures, setup, results, and findings of the proposed framework. These subsections are as follows: a. experimental measurements This experiment has been carried out on the dataset discussed in Sec. III (A). The dataset contains eight significant attributes. From these attributes, six different combinations have been considered as the experimental measurements. The
combinations are as follows:
i) (Density, Infected)
ii) (Density, Death)
iii) (Density, Recovered)
iv) (Death, Recovered)
v) (Infected, Death)
vi) (Infected, Recovered) b. experimental setup This experiment was conducted using Python programming language on the Kaggle online platform. It was carried out on a desktop computer containing Windows 11 with an Intel Core i5 processor running at 3.10 GHz and 12 GB of RAM. Though several complex mathematical operations were needed in the model, still no parallel processing was applied to the experiment. c. experimental results This section has been divided into five parts, i.e., i) plotting the data points, ii) Pearson’s correlation coefficient, iii) Spearman’s correlation coefficient, iv) Kendall’s correlation coefficient, and v) success of lockdown. They are
described below. i) Plotting the data points: Initially, the data points are illustrated with a scatter plot for the six combinations of attributes as mentioned in Sec. IV (A). Fig. 3 represents the corresponding scatter plots. Here, in each combination, it is visible that the corresponding attributes are positively correlated. However, determining the strength of correlation only by examining the scatter plot is difficult. Here, the correlation coefficient helps to find out the strength of
the correlations. ii) Pearson’s correlation coefficient: The value of r for Pearson’s correlation according to (1) has been calculated for the six combinations of attributes. Table III shows the corresponding values of those combinations. The remarks about the strength of correlation [27] for each combination have also been
mentioned as an indication. v) Success of lockdown: Since different counties were enforcing lockdowns in different parts, some were
successful (1) and some were a failure (0). Here, a visual
representation is shown in fig. 4 which indicates that the
success of lockdown is mostly seen in the regions with a
lower density of population. Still, some regions with higher density tackled the coronavirus with different precautionary
measures including proper supply of daily goods, and
medicines, maintaining proper rules, complete separation of
social engagement, etc. [28]. d. findings and directions From Tables 3, 4, and 5, it can be observed that the combinations “infected vs death” and “infected vs recovered” have strong positive correlations. This indicates that in any region, the number of deaths and recovered patients increased with the number of infected people. Moreover, other combinations exhibited moderate and weak correlations. Among them, the combinations paired with density have weak correlations, which indicates that density had less effect on infected, dead, and recovered patients compared to other combinations. However, it cannot be concluded that density does not play a vital role in the number of infected, dead, and recovered patients. Although it has some impact, still it is moderate and weak in most cases [20]. Furthermore, fig. 4 demonstrates a strong correlation between the success [18] of the lockdown and the population density of the regions, which in turn is closely linked to the rates of infection, death, and recovery among patients. Hence, in the future, the spread of any pandemic situation can be controlled by reducing the number of infected and dead patients as well as comparatively increasing the number of recovered patients. Furthermore, a critical factor in reducing the spread of a pandemic is the reduction of population density in any given location. Decreasing population density can significantly contribute to mitigating the transmission

By implementing measures to reduce population density, such as promoting remote work, implementing social distancing guidelines, and encouraging decentralized living arrangements, the future spread of pandemics can be effectively
reduced and proper safety can be ensured. V. CONCLUSIONS
This research studies COVID-19 data from December 2019 to
December 2022 and examines the success or failure of
lockdowns enforced in different regions worldwide. Initially, the
authors collected data by considering different factors related to
COVID-19 and generated a comprehensive dataset that included
the success or failure of lockdowns in various regions of the
world. Then, different correlation-finding methods have been
applied to the comprehensive dataset. This study shows that the
number of deaths and recovered patients increased at a high rate
with the number of infected patients. Moreover, the population
density loosely affected the number of recovered patients. Again, the measures behind the success of the lockdown are
mostly related to the population density of regions. So, by
ensuring the measures that have been discussed in the findings section, the spread of any pandemic can be reduced in the future.
