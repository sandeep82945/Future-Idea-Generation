Chemical pressure for synthesis of functional materials
Kun Lina, Qiang Lia, Runze Yua, Jun Chena, and J. Paul Attfieldb,*, Xianran Xinga,*
Chemical pressure, a strange but familiar concept, is a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications and arouses
great interest due to its diversity and efficiency to synthesize new compounds and tune functional materials. Different from
physical pressure loaded by external force that is positive, chemical pressure can be either positive or negative (contract a
lattice or expand it), often through flexible and mild chemical synthesis strategies, which are particularly important as a
degree of freedom to manipulate material behaviors. In this tutorial review, we summarize the features of chemical pressure
as a methodology and demonstrate its role in synthesizing and discovering some typical magnetic, electric, and thermal
responsive functional materials. The measure of chemical pressure using experimental lattice strain and elastic modulus was
proposed, which can be used for quantitative descriptions of the correlation between lattice distortion and property. From
a lattice strain point of view, we classify chemical pressure into different categories: (i) chemical substitution, (ii) chemical
intercalation/de-intercalation, (iii) size effect, and (iv) interface constraint, etc. Chemical pressure, combining chemical
bonding, lattice symmetry, local structure, electron structure and phonon structure effects etc., is a general and effective
method for synthesizing new compounds and tuning functional materials. 1. The nature of chemical pressure and its features in comparison with physical pressure. 2. Experimental ways to measure chemical pressure. 3. Diverse routes to achieve chemical pressure: (i) chemical substitution, (ii) chemical intercalation/de-intercalation, (iii) size effect, (iv) interface
constraint, etc. 4. The role of chemical pressure in modulating magnetic, electric, and thermal responsive functional materials. 5. Current challenges and perspectives of the chemical pressure method for achieving high-performance functional materials. introduction Although unfamiliar to many people, the terminology of
“chemical pressure” emerged as a physical quantify nearly one
hundred years ago. The story can be traced back to the early
twentieth century when the volume of an atom was found to be
compressive. T. W. Richards et al. claimed that there must be a
“intrinsic distending pressure”, i.e., chemical pressure, to resist
external pressure and chemical affinity in matter:
p +  = p + P (1)
where p presents external physical pressure,  presents
chemical affinity, p presents intrinsic distending or repulsive pressure (chemical pressure), and P present thermal pressure— the force of lattice strain induced by thermal expansion.1, 2 That is, chemical pressure is a passive interatomic
force exerted to balance the internal and external forces in
solids. One of the most useful feature of chemical pressure is
that it can be modified by elemental substitutions, which
facilely controls atomic distance in solids like physical pressure does.3, 4 Studies to correlate chemical pressure with physical
pressure have been carried out, e.g. Nowik et al. reported that
the valence-phase-transition temperature (Tν) in Yb0.41n0.6Cu2 intermetallic compound decreases with both physical pressure
(hydrostatic pressure) and chemical pressure (via substitution of Yb3+ with La3+).3 The “chemical pressure” concept became
popular for explaining variations in the critical temperature of
superconductor families such as the copper oxides first
discovered in the 1980’s and the iron-based superconductors in the 2000’s.5-7 Since then, chemical pressure has been widely
used as a counterpoint strategy to physical pressure in the
design and synthesis of solids, notably magnetic, electric, and
thermal responsive functional materials where properties are
very sensitive to lattice strain. The key point of chemical pressure method is the generation
of lattice strain, which is realized by a chemical way instead of a
physical one. It changes transitions such as the spin, orbital, and
charge orderings of atoms in the lattice, and thus has important
influence on material properties. The scope of the chemical
pressure method has grown with the chemistry diversity of
manipulating the lattice in solids. The employment of chemical
pressure has been increasing recognized as a diverse and
effective strategy to control material structures at multiple a) Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute of Solid State Chemistry, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, 100083, China.

levels and hence to tailor the performances. In this tutorial
review, we discussed the nature of chemical pressure and its
features in comparison with physical pressure, and we redefine
it as a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications. Chemical pressure can be introduced by the following four chemical routes: (i) elemental substitution8-12, (ii) small molecules intercalation/de-intercalation13-16, (iii) size effect17-21, and (iv) chemical interfaces22-26. An experimental method to
quantify chemical pressure is proposed. Furthermore, the
critical role of chemical pressure in modulating materials
properties are exampled in a series of magnetic, electric, and
thermal responsive functional materials. Finally, we
summarized the current challenges and perspectives of
chemical pressure method. Kun Lin is a professor at Institute

It is intuitive that applying a high physical pressure on a solid
can change its lattice through compressibility, which alters the
chemistry of an atom by activating its inner electrons and
unoccupied orbitals, leading to many new and surprising phenomena27, 28. Alternatively, the lattice can be changed by a
chemical route at ambient pressure, i.e., by chemical pressure. The critical role of physical pressure in synthesizing new
compounds and revealing new physics in solids is evident;
nevertheless, high pressure synthesis and characterizations are generally complex and expensive27, 29. Besides, some solid
materials, based on radioactive actinides for instance, are not convenient for characterization under physical pressure30. By
comparison, chemical pressure is a gentle and convenient way
to change the size of a lattice, which facilitates both material
synthesis and property characterizations. The importance of chemical pressure can be well exampled
in the studies of 1111-type LnFeAsO-based superconductors (Ln
= Rare earths). LnFeAsO-based compounds generally adopt
tetragonal P4/nmm symmetry, constituted by edge-sharing
FeAs4 and (O,F)Ln4 tetrahedra layers stacking alternatively along the [001] axis (Fig. 1a). Hosono et al. discovered the appearance
of superconductivity in LaFeAs(O1-xFx) (x = 0.05-0.12) with Tc of 26 K.31 Immediately, it was found that increasing the pressure
enables a rapid increase in the Tc of LaFeAs(O1-xFx). The onset Tc reaches a maximum of 43 K, well above the McMillan limit,32 at 4 GPa and then decreases with further increasing pressure.33
Interestingly, the emergent high-temperature
superconductivity can be realized by chemical pressure method at ambient pressure. Replacing La3+ with smaller rare earth
cations in LnFeAs(O1-xFx) (x ≈ 0.10), the Tc increases from 26 K for La3+ to 41 K for Ce3+, to 52 K for Pr3+, and to a maximum of 55 K for Sm3+,34 which further decreases to 51 K for Tb3+, to 41 K for Dy3+, and to 33 K for Ho3+.35 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1b-
1c, chemical pressure and physical pressure have rather similar
superconducting phase diagrams for the LnFeAsO-based
compounds. Fig. 1c shows the pnictogen height (the distance of
the As to the Fe plane in the FeAs layers) dependence of Tc for the typical Fe-based superconductors. There exists a generally
symmetric curve with a peak around a critical pnictogen height of 1.38 Å that is in favor of superconducting state.36, 37 The
universal mechanism for both physical pressure and chemical
pressure can be understood by the regulation of pnictogen
height in Fe-based superconductors. This also illustrates the
more general point that chemical pressure effects in complex
materials can be positive or negative. This arises when some
structural geometry is optimum for the property of interest
(represented by the pnictogen height in the LnFeAs(O1-xFx) series). Starting from the largest Ln = La, increasing chemical pressure (decreasing Ln3+ radius) initially increases Tc until geometry is optimum for Ln = Sm, but then decreases it for the
smaller Ln cations as shown in Fig. 1c. Another example of
optimal structure geometry is in perovskites with tolerance
factor t =1 as described later in the Chemical Substitution
section. The first superconductor with Tc higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, YBa2Cu3O7, was also designed by a chemical pressure method (replacing La3+ in La2-xBaxCuO4 with Y3+) although this led to an unexpected change in structure type.7, 34

open symbols are the data under the optimal pressure. Details are shown in Ref. (37). Red diamonds (marked by arrow) indicate physical pressure on LaFeAs(O1-xFx). Physical pressure changes the lattice in solids without
introducing other variables. However, chemical pressure
usually brings new variables to the parent material, such as new
atoms, molecules, or interfaces. These new variables alter the
structure of the host lattice at multiple levels, and can modify
material properties as well. To isolate the “pressure” effect of
chemical pressure, elements with similar chemical properties
but different sizes, i.e., possessing the same charges and similar
electronic structures, are ideal. Common examples are lanthanide (rare earth) Ln3+ cations and M2+ alkaline earth (M =
Ca, Sr, Ba) cations, as illustrated in studies of chemical pressure
effects on LnFeAs(O1-xFx) superconductors above and thermoelectric performance in LnSb2O2 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Ho, and Er),11 and on phonon vibration in Ba1−xSrxFCl (0 ≤ x ≤ 3)38. A great advantage of chemical pressure is that both positive pressure and negative pressure can be realized.18, 21, 39-41
Physical pressure presses a material down and diminishes its
volume, which is usually defined as positive pressure. By
contrast, chemical pressure can either diminish the volume or expand it, see Fig. 2.42-44 The latter is usually defined as negative
(chemical) pressure. Negative pressure provides an important
degree of freedom for materials design in solids, making it a
powerful method to synthesize new solids and to discover unusual properties.18, 21, 40, 41 In freestanding PbTiO3 nanowires, for example, negative pressure produces a lower-density “PX”
phase to a higher-density perovskite phase transformation,
which enhances the tetragonality, Curie temperature and spontaneous polarization.18 In CuO and MnF2 nanoparticles, the negative pressure induced by size effect greatly prompts the
magneto-lattice effect and transforms the thermal expansion
behavior from positive to negative below the magnetic ordering temperature.17
Due to structural anisotropy, chemical pressure can possess
different signs along different directions, i.e., it can be negative
along one crystallographic direction while being positive along
another. Semimetal bismuth has the rhombohedral A7-type
structure built up by corrugated layers parallel to the (111) planes.19 Inside the plane, each atom is bonded to three
nearest-neighbor atoms at 3.072 Å by a so-called metal-metal
covalent bond, while the shortest distance between the atoms
in adjacent layers is 3.529 Å. This gives rise to strong anisotropy
in Young’s modulus of 21 GPa and 31 GPa respectively along the a and c axis45. When the particle size reduces to the nanoscale, size effect-induced chemical pressure are strongly anisotropic.19
When average particles sizes reduced to 28.5nm and 13.1 nm,
the a axis contracts by 0.42% and 0.54%, corresponding to
positive chemical pressure of 0.13 GPa and 0.17 GPa; while the
c axis expands by 0.24% and 0.67%, corresponding to negative
chemical pressure of -0.05 GPa and -0.14 GPa (Fig. 3a). The
anisotropic chemical pressure increases the bond angle that
relaxes under the thermal activation with rising temperature,
and induces a transition of coefficient of thermal expansion
from positive to negative along the c axis in nanosized bismuth. 19 By compassion, the size effect-induced chemical pressure in
cubic ScF3 has the same sign (P>0 here) due to its isotropic character (Fig. 3b)46. measure of chemical pressure Although widely used, chemical pressure has not been truly measured and quantified by experiments so far21, 41, 47-49. Physical pressure is external and can be quantified by direct or
indirect measurement of force/area, while chemical pressure is
internal and cannot be measured directly. Instead, the degree
of lattice strain was often used to describe chemical pressure in

solids, such as 2% compressive strain of chemical pressure12, 26, 41, 49. However, using lattice strain to evaluate chemical pressure
is indirect and inadequate. This is because the comparison of
chemical pressures by a lattice strain method is limited to the
specific materials in a study, as different materials types differ greatly in compressibility or elastic modulus1. We can assert that a 2% lattice strain in Ba1-xSrxTiO3 by Sr2+ substitution for Ba2+ produces a larger chemical pressure than a 1% strain does,
but we cannot simply assert that a 2% strain in Fe1-xNix produces a larger chemical pressure than a 1% strain in Ba1-xSrxTiO3. Furthermore, chemical pressure should have the same
force/area units as external pressure (Pa, bar, torr, etc.). So,
how to quantify the chemical pressure? Fredrickson et al. have developed a density functional
theory-chemical pressure (DFT-CP) analysis based on electronic interaction in intermetallic compounds50, 51:

𝜕𝑉 = −∑ ∑

where E is the total energy expressed as a sum of onsite and pairwise interaction terms52, V is cell volume, Hij is the Hamiltonian matrix elements of (Hij), on is the occupancy of that crystal orbital, cn,j is the coefficient of atomic orbital j in crystal orbital n, Norb is the number of orbitals in the crystal, and pij is the pressure arising from the interaction between atomic
orbitals i and j (i = j terms are zero). The DFT-CP method can be
employed to calculate and interpret the chemical pressure distributions inside the crystal structures based on DFT results.9, 50, 51, 53 For example, they calculated the 2-Huckel chemical pressure of SrAg5 and a hypothetical CaAg5 phase (Fig. 4). The Sr atom has a net negative chemical pressure of -8.2 GPa, which
is balanced by the positive chemical pressure values of the Ag
atoms of 1.7 GPa. Replacing Sr with the smaller Ca, the net
chemical pressure at the Ca atom increases to -10.2 GPa; such a
strong chemical pressure drives a transition to the Ca2Ag7 structure with chemical pressure reduced to -1.2 GPa. The DFT-
CP method is a useful tool to calculate the chemical pressure at
atomic level, and provides visual prediction of the structural
stability and phase transformation. Besides the above theoretical analysis, here we propose two
experimental ways to quantify chemical pressure in solids. The
first one is to apply both physical pressure and chemical
pressure to a material; the magnitude of chemical pressure
should equal to that of physical pressure that (if it can) causes
the same lattice strain (or volume change, in the parent
material), see Fig. 5. In other words, if the chemical pressure
and the physical pressure generate the same lattice (or volume)
change in a material, we propose that they are equivalent in
magnitude. This idea is analogue to an ancient Chinese idiom
story “Cao Chong weighs an elephant”: the mass of an elephant
is determined by weighing many stones that generate the same
draught (water-displacement) of a boat, instead of weighing the
elephant itself. The second experiment method introduced below is more
convenient and straightforward and so we highly recommend it. In material science, the relationship between strain and stress
in a material follows the Hooke’s law during elastic deformation
σ = E e, where σ is the stress, e is the strain along loading
direction, and E is the Young’s modulus. Since the nature of
chemical pressure can also be considered as elastic lattice strain,
in a chemical way instead of a physical one, we can describe chemical pressure by applying Eq. (1-2):54
𝑑𝑃 = −𝐸 𝑑𝑥
𝑥0 (3)
where dP is chemical pressure, dx is the change in lattice size
(by chemical pressure), x0 is initial lattice size, and E is Young’s modulus. All parameters, dx, x0 and E, are measurable (dx and a0 can be determined by X-ray diffraction, E can be measured by velocity measurement and is known or can be calculated for
most compounds). The negative sign defines compressive stress
to be positive and tensile stress to be negative, to keep in
accordance with physical pressure. Alternatively, we can use
the volumetric change to describe chemical pressure by:

𝑑𝑃 = −𝐾 𝑑𝑉
𝑉0 (4)
where dV is the change in cell volume, V0 is initial cell volume, and K is bulk modulus (K = E/[3(1-2)],  is Poisson's ratio). In
fact, Eq. (4) is most often used to describe the compressibility
of material under uniform hydrostatic pressure. Note that the
modulus of E and K vary with composition, but the change is
relatively small when the structure-type and chemical
composition do not change much (e.g., K is 97 GPa, 93 GPa and 103 GPa respectively for YFe2, TbFe2 and ErFe255). Eq. (3) describes the chemical pressure along a certain
direction in solids, which is especially useful for thin films and
low symmetry structures where the lattice strain is highly
anisotropic. Orientation dependence is unique to chemical
pressure. It plays a key role in many remarkable physical
properties that are inaccessible by isotropic hydrostatic physical
pressure, such as the emergent polar vortices in ferroelectric thin films.18, 22, 24, 49, 56 Eq. (4) is more suitable for isotropic
chemical pressure, like size effect in nanoparticles, and
chemical substitution in high symmetry structures. We note
that from Eq. (3) and (4), the magnitude of chemical pressure is
a relative value. Its value should be based on a given reference
state that is defined as the unstrained state. For a given
reference state, the chemical pressure is proportional to the
rigidity of the structure and the degree of deformation it
undergoes. The magnitude of chemical pressure obtained from
Eq. (3) and (4) can be used for quantitative comparison among
solids in different types. Some examples of chemical pressure
values in solids based on experimental lattice strain and elastic
modulus are shown in Table 1. Diverse routes for chemical pressure
Chemical substitution The most used chemical pressure
method is chemical substitution by introducing different atoms
into the lattice. (This is most simply done by using cations of the
same valence as noted above, as introduction of aliovalent
species can lead to further effects such as electronic doping or
vacancy or interstitial formation.) Up to some limit of structural
tolerance, an atom in the host lattice can be replaced by a new
one of different size. If replaced by a larger one, the lattice
expands and vice versa, known as Vegard’s law if the lattice

parameters change linearly76. The substitution produces a
stereochemical interaction at the substitution site and a local
strain gradient propagating from it (Fig. 6a). This brings negative
or positive pressure to the host lattice, breaks the ideal 3D
translational periodicity, and changes the properties in solids. Negative thermal expansion (NTE) in open-framework
structure is driven by low-frequency phonon modes, which is
coupled to structural symmetry and can be well-controlled by chemical pressure77, 78. For example, ScF3 has a cubic ReO3-type structure (Pm-3m) built up by corner sharing ScF6 octahedra and displays unusual NTE covering a broad temperature range of 10- 1100 K79. The NTE is correlated to the rotary coupling of the ScF6 octahedra rigid units with the average Sc-F-Sc angle to be 180° (Fig. 6b)79, 80, generating phonon modes with negative Grüneisen parameters46, 81. Slight chemical substitution by
isovalent but smaller cations, i.e., (Sc0.85Ga0.05Fe0.1)F3, introduces positive chemical pressure to the structure (Fe3+: 0.645 Å, Ga3+: 0.62 Å, Sc3+: 0.745 Å)8. X-ray pair distribution
function (PDF) analysis indicates that the symmetry of
(Sc0.85Ga0.05Fe0.1)F3 transforms to rhombohedral in the shortrange (R-3c, r < 20 Å). Such a chemical pressure induced
structure distortion changes the Sc-F-Sc bond angle to be 173.3°,
which hinders the transverse thermal vibration of fluorine
atoms. As a result, the NTE is suppressed to zero thermal expansion (Fig. 6c)8. The short-range structure of ScF3 can be further modulated by chemical pressure method in the MZrF6 series (M = Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn). It was found that the
flexibility of the metal···F atomic linkage driven by size misfit at
the M site governs the phonon modes and thus controls the
thermal expansion. A flexible metal···F atomic linkage induces
NTE for M = Ca, Mn, Fe; while the stiff ones bring positive
thermal expansion (PTE) for M = Ni, Co. Thus, thermal expansion
could be tuned from negative, to zero, and to positive by the chemical substitution method (Fig. 6d)82. The piezoelectric effect arises from net movement of
positive and negative ions with respect to each other under
stress, resulting in an electric dipole or polarization. The
mobility and flexibility of cations are sensitive to their local
coordination environments and are liable to variation by
chemical pressure. Li et al. conducted chemical substitution using traces of small Sm3+ cations (1.24 Å) for Pb2+ (1.49 Å)
cations in Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3 (PMN–PT) solid solutions and introduced positive chemical pressure. A combined atomic-
lever scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and
first-principles calculations demonstrated that the substitution
induces significant local structural heterogeneity, which
perturbs the local order parameters of polarization, and leads
to heterogeneous polar regions and additional interfacial energies10 (Fig. 7a,7b). As a result, an extraordinarily large piezoelectric constant (d33 > 1,500 pC N–1) was observed in 2.5 mol% Sm-modified into 0.71Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.29PbTiO3 (2.5Sm-71PMN–29PT) ceramic, in large contrast to the undoped counterpart (~500 pC N–1)83 (Fig. 7c,7d). In 1 mol% Sm-modified
70PMN-30PT single crystal, they achieved an even larger piezoelectric constant (d33 > 3400 pC N–1)10 Similarly, Ranjan et al. reported an extraordinarily large electrostrain up to 1.3% in
La-doped 0.55Bi1–yLayFeO3–0.45PbTiO3 (y = 0.3) solid solution ceramics84. Such a large electrostrain behavior is related to the
chemical pressure induced structure disorder due to size misfit among Pb2+, Bi2+ and La3+ cations, which leads to a low-
symmetry ferroelectric phase, a large spontaneous lattice strain,
domain miniaturization, and an appropriate ferroelectric domain switching84. 8 | J. Name. , 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx

Generally, the extent of chemical substitution has an upper
limit. It depends mainly on the size, charge, and
electronegativity of the atoms— the more similar the atoms,
the higher degree of the substitution. In simple structure types,
the range of sizes can be quantified based on geometric
relations. This is much studied in the ABX3-type perovskite structure where the limit of chemical substitution can be evaluated by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t 85:
𝑡 = 𝑟𝐴+𝑟𝑋
√2(𝑟𝐵+𝑟𝑋) (5)
where rA, rB, and rX are the average ionic radii of A, B and X site species respectively. For an ideal cubic perovskite structure t =
1, indicating that the structure is perfectly matched among A, B
and X cations. In BaMO3 (M = transition metal) perovskites, for example, the tolerance factor t is largely within the range of 0.93–1.0586. Transition temperatures for electronic or magnetic
orders typically have a maximum value at t = 1 and decrease rapidly as t falls away from this value.87 The same is also true in
principle for t >1, but in practice this often leads to changes in
structure to other hexagonal-type perovskites. High (physical)
pressure has been used to stabilize some cubic-type BaMO3 perovskites, e.g. cubic-BaRuO3 (t = 1.06) has ferromagnetic TC = 60 K whereas SrRuO3 (t = 1.02) has TC = 160 K.88
Chemical intercalation/de-intercalation. Chemical
intercalation (or de-intercalation) reaction introduces (or
removes) new chemical entities into (or from) a host lattice,
such as molecular water, carbon dioxide, etc. The intercalation
(or de-intercalation) of these guests expands (or shrinks) the
host lattice and hence induces chemical pressure. This kind of
chemical pressure is usually introduced in metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) or other inorganic structures with significant void space13, 15, 89, 90. The MOF compound [{Ru2(F3PhCO2)4}2TCNQ(OEt)2] (1) crystallizes in a triclinic D2A-layered structure and displays ferromagnetic ordering at ground state (Fig. 8a) (30). Viewing
down the a’ axis, the four CN groups of TCNQ(OEt)2 are coordinated with the [Ru2] units to form a wavy layered twodimensional network (D2A layer) that lies on the (020) plane with an interlayer distance of 8.07 Å (Fig. 8b). This compound
absorbs CO2 into the center of the hexagonal fishnet with an amount of 113 ml STP g−1 (10.6 molecules per formula unit) at
99 kPa (1⊃CO2). Accordingly, the cell volume increases sharply from 1763.0(2) Å3 for 1 to 2172.3(3) Å3 for 1⊃CO2 by a rate of 23%, and induces significant negative chemical pressure of -3.05
GPa (B = 13.3 GPa by our calculations) to the lattice (Fig. 8c). As
a result, the TCNQ(OEt)2 and Ru−N − C bending angle reduces accordingly in 1⊃CO2, flattening the D2A layer and expanding interlayer distance to 8.93 Å (Fig. 8d). Due to the sensitivity of
magnetism to the distance between magnetic atoms, this
switches the electronic state from a one-electron-transferred
state into the neutral state, and transforms the magnetic
property from ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic (Fig. 8e-8g). Such
a magnetic phase change is reversable by the guest CO2 molecules intercalation/de-intercalation in the framework16. In open-framework structures, the NTE originates from
transverse thermal vibrations of atoms where the “true” bond
lengths are longer than “apparent” bond length, as schemed in
Fig. 9a. Such transverse thermal vibrations should be hindered
or reduced by additional chemical pressure from guest ions or molecules in the empty space of framework.14, 77 For YFe(CN)6based Prussian blue analogues, the NTE is dominated by the
transverse motion of N and C atoms. In YFe(CN)6, Fe atoms coordinates to six C atoms to form regular octahedra (FeC6) and Y atoms coordinates to six N atoms to give a bicapped distorted
trigonal prism (YN6). The FeC6 and YN6 groups are bridged through CN units in the entire structure with nearly linear Y-NFe linkage (176.01(1)°). After intercalation, K+ and H2O are located in the pores near the YN6 trigonal prism of YFe(CN)6, see Fig. 9c,9f. and the cell volume and atomic positions change due
to electrostatic interactions. The cell volume of KYFe(CN)6 dramatically contracts by 18.3% compared with that of YFe(CN)6 accompanied by a reduction of Y-N-Fe angle (140.54(5)°). These
guest ions or molecules act as barriers to block the transverse
thermal vibrations. As shown in Fig. 9d,9e, the transverse vibrational mode of NTE in YFe(CN)6 at 44 cm-1 shows the

strongest negative Grüneisen parameter and is the main
contribution to NTE. However, for KYFe(CN)6, the low-frequency contribution of N and C atoms is much weakened due to the presence of K+ ions. The lowest energy mode of KYFe(CN)6 at 49.6 cm-1 has a small negative value of Grüneisen parameter
(Fig. 9g,9h). In this way, the thermal expansion of YFe(CN)6 can be substantially switched from strong negative (αV = -33.6710- 6 K-1) to positive by chemical pressure induced by the addition of guest H2O molecules or K+ ions (αV = 20.3  10-6 K-1 for KYFe(CN)6, αV = 27.7110-6 K-1 for YFe(CN)6‧4H2O, αV= 42.72 10- 6 K-1 for KYFe(CN)6‧3H2O (Fig. 9b).14
Size effect. Surface atoms have unique electronic states and
coordination environments compared with those in the interior. The lattice at the surface of solids usually undergoes a strained state20. When particle size decreases to nanoscale, such a lattice
strain could penetrate throughout the whole (or most of the)
particle. As the size of nanoparticles can be well-controlled by
chemical synthesis, we categorize the size effect-induced lattice
strain as another type of chemical pressure. Besides lattice
strain, the chemical pressure from size effect can even change
the structural symmetry, spin state, and phonon vibration when the particle size reduces below a critical value91, 92. Sun et al. synthesized ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) with sizes of 12 nm, 36 nm, and 1 µm through a two-phase solvothermal method21. It was found that there exists a
negative chemical pressure in PbTiO3 NPs which strengthens with reducing of particle size with ΔV/Vbulk = 0%, 0.4%, and 2.2% for 1 µm (bulk), 36 nm, and 12 nm, corresponding to chemical
pressure values of 0 MPa, -558 MPa, and -3.0 GPa (the bulk modulus K of PbTiO3 is 141 GPa75), see Fig. 10. The structural origin of the size effect was investigated by X-ray PDF and XAFS
analysis. It shows that the nearest Pb-OII bonds (equatorial)
shortens with reduced NP size while the nearest Pb-OI bonds
(vertex) elongates, accompanied by an enhanced off-centering
of Ti ions in the octahedra. Further aberration-corrected STEM
images indicate that the as-prepared PbTiO3 NPs surfaces are dominated by PbO-terminal layers. These PbO-terminals are
produced by the confined synthesis of the two-phase
solvothermal route (Fig. 10b). With particle size decreases to
nanoscale, the number of surface ions of nanomaterials
increases geometrically: the overall atomic ratio Pb/Ti increases
from 1.00 for 1 µm to 1.13 for 12 nm. This significantly alters
the average coordination environment of Pb atom and
enhances the size effect. Further theoretical calculation shows

that the electronic structure origin of chemical pressure is
related to the hybridizations between Pb 6s and O 2pz orbitals of PbO-terminated surface and between Ti 3dz2 and O 2pz orbitals of TiO6 octahedra, which yield raised tetragonality and large spontaneous polarization in PbTiO3 NPs (Fig. 10).21
Antiperovskite manganese nitrides (Mn3AN, A = Cu, Zn, Sn, etc.) are well-studied for their interesting NTE behaviors driven
by magnetism. Song et al. prepared three different
microstructures of antiperovskite manganese nitrides
Mn3Cu0.5Ge0.5N: coarse-grained polycrystalline (mean grain size ≈ 2.0 μm), nanocrystalline (mean grain size ≈ 30 nm), and ultrananocrystalline (mean grain size ≈ 12 nm), see Fig. 11.93 All these
three materials adopt cubic Pm-3m symmetry. Neutron
diffraction shows that the Mn occupancy decreases from 100%
in the coarse-grained (Mn1000) to ≈ 87.8% in the
nanocrystalline (Mn878) and to ≈ 78.7% in the ultra-
nanocrystalline (Mn787) material. The cell parameters reduce
from 3.91211(9) Å (Mn1000) to 3.89799(7) Å (Mn878) and to
3.89332(7) Å (Mn787). This produces chemical pressures of 0
GPa, 2.7 GPa and 3.6 GPa, respectively. Such size effect weakens
the magnetic ordering of Mn sublattice with site 3c Mn moment
reducing from ~3.0 B to 2.6 B and 2.2 B, TC decreasing from 340 K to 260 K and 230 K, for Mn1000, Mn878 and Mn787,
respectively. As a result, the CTE changes from strongly negative (α = -17.1× 10−6 K−1, 260-340 K) to moderately negative (α = - 3.89× 10−6 K−1, 160-260 K) and to ZTE (0.118 ×10-7 K-1, 12-230 K), see Fig. 11.93
Interface constraint. In epitaxial thin films, the lattice of the
film is constrained and modulated by the substrate via the
“biaxial strain” (binding in-plane but free in the out-of-plane
direction), which is another form of chemical pressure24, 26, 94. This method is widely used to favour metastable phases over
the equilibrium phase (epitaxial stabilization). Especially for
brittle oxides, the lattice strain in the film can reach as large as
several %, one order of magnitude larger than that in bulk (~ 0.1%)94. As shown in Fig. 12a,12b, through screening substrates
with different in-plane lattice constant (changes either
substrate type or its orientation), both positive and negative
chemical pressure can be achieved, prominently expanding
material functions such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, band gap, and superconductivity22, 24, 48. When lattice misfit is large,
dislocations can arise, which tends to relax the large lattice
strain. To avoid these dislocations, the thickness of the film should be below a critical thickness94, 95. Xu et al. grew 100 nm α-formamidinium lead iodide (α-
FAPbI3) epitaxial films on a series of mixed methylammonium lead chloride/bromide (MAPbClxBr3−x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5) single crystalline substrates, Fig. 12c,12d26. In their freestanding form,
both α-FAPbI3 and MAPbClxBr3−x are cubic with Pm3m space group. The lattice constants are 6.35 Å for freestanding α-
FAPbI3 and 5.83–5.95 Å for MAPbClxBr3-x substrates, indicating that a positive in-plane chemical pressure was imposed on the
α-FAPbI3 film. As x increases from 0 to 1.5, the lattice parameter a of the substrate reduces, which causes a strain of 2.4% and a
biaxial chemical pressure of 1.32 GPa, see Fig. 12e (The chemical
pressure is calculated by P = C12  c/c, where C12 is the transverse elastic constant of FAPbI3 (= -5.5±2.2 GPa)96). Such a strain effectively changes the crystal structure, reduces the
bandgap, increases the hole mobility of α-FAPbI3, and hence increases the external quantum efficiency (Fig. 12f)26. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J. Name ., 2013, 00 , 1-3 | 11

Alternative to biaxial strain imposed by 2D substrate, a new
interfacial chemical pressure method– “interphase strain” method, was proposed recently25. Two materials with similar
crystal structures, but different lattice parameters, are used to
grow in a single composite with coherent lattice matching. In
this way, an isotropic and 3D compression or tensile strain can
be introduced into the material that originally had the larger or
smaller lattice parameters, respectively. For example, PbTiO3 adopts a tetragonal perovskite structure with lattice constants
a = 3.899 Å, c =4.154 Å, and c/a = 1.065 (Fig. 13a); PbO adopts a
plate-like tetragonal structure but with a large c/a ratio (a =
3.973 Å, c =5.022 Å, and c/a = 1.264), see Fig. 13b. In the
PbTiO3/PbO composite fabricated by “interphase strain” method, PbTiO3 and PbO share the same c lattice constant (4.840 Å) (Fig. 13c-13d). As a result, a super-strong negative
chemical pressure of -24 GPa was generated with a super-
tetragonal distortion (c/a = 1.238) in PbTiO3 (ΔV/Vbulk = 17.1%), which induces a state-of-art remanent polarization of 236.3 C/cm2 25. The “interphase strain” method can also be extended to other materials (111).54 For BaTiO3/BaO, the negative chemical pressure (~ -5.7 GPa) was imposed by the coherent lattice strain
from large cubic BaO to small tetragonal BaTiO3, generating high tetragonality (c/a = 1.12) and facilitating large
displacements of Ti. This leads to the record remanent polarization Pr (100 μC/cm2) in any forms of BaTiO3 to date with
a high Curie temperature Tc (above 1000 °C), see Fig. 13f,13g. It was reported that such negative pressure alters the bonding
states, i.e. inducing bonding of Ba 5p-O 2p hybridization (which
is ionic bonding in bulk), and strong-bonding of Ti eg and O 2p, which contribute to the tremendously enhanced polarization
(111). The interphase strain method has the advantage of
providing not only isotropic negative chemical pressure but also
isotropic positive chemical pressure, through selective phase
matches, and the magnitude of chemical pressure can be modulated by adjusting the composition.54 conclusions and outlook This review summarizes the development of chemical
pressure and defines the concept as a methodology for material
design: a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications. The main feature of chemical pressure is that the lattice strain
is caused by a chemical way, instead of physical one, and hence
is diverse and does not require extreme conditions. As shown in
Fig. 14, applying chemical pressure not only changes the lattice
size itself, but can also change the spin, orbital, and charge
orderings of the relevant atoms. These changes alter material structures at various levels, including lattice symmetry53, 97, local structure8, 9, 82, electronic structure98, 99, and phonon structure38, 46, and hence influences material properties by
virtue of structure-property relationship (Fig. 14). By proposing
two equations for quantification, we can see that the limit of
chemical pressure is generally within several GPa, around two
orders of magnitude smaller than that of the highest achievable
physical pressures. The largest value, -24 GPa to our best
knowledge, was realized via a newly proposed “interphase
strain” method in a PbTiO3/PbO coherent lattice, and is accompanied by an unusual ferroelectric response25. More
novel methods enabling stronger chemical pressures would be
highly attractive to realize striking or unusual properties in the
future. More details, such as local strain gradient and its
propagation from substitution site, and the electronic and
phonon structures induced by the breaking of ideal 3D
translational periodicity, remain for further exploration of new
phenomena in solids by chemical pressure methods. 12 | J. Name. , 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx
