Polyketides are an important class of structurally diverse natural products derived from a precursor molecule consisting of a chain of alternating ketone and methylene groups. These compounds have attracted the worldwide attention of pharmaceutical researchers since they are endowed with a wide array of biological properties. As one of the most common filamentous fungi in nature, Aspergillus spp. is well known as an excellent producer of polyketide compounds with therapeutic potential. By extensive literature search and data analysis, this review comprehensively summarizes Aspergillus-derived polyketides for the first time, regarding their occurrences, chemical structures and bioactivities as well as biosynthetic logics. 1. introduction Polyketides are a highly diverse group of natural products having structurally intriguing carbon skeletons, such as polyphenols, macrolides, polyenes, enediynes, and polyethers [1]. These substances encompass an important source of pharmaceutically relevant molecules, such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, antiparasitics, cholesterollowering, and antitumoral agents [2–6]. Biosynthetically, polyketide motifs are biochemically formed by acetyl-CoA units undergoing a sequence of events catalyzed by polyketide synthases (PKS), a multi-enzyme complex that is highly homologous to fatty acid synthase (FAS) [7]. As one of the ubiquitous fungi in nature, the genus Aspergillus has recently received much more attention owing to its great biosynthetic potential of secondary metabolites (SMs) with nutritional, agrochemical and medicinal applications [8]. By the end of 2022, over 3100 Aspergillus-derived SMs had been isolated and collected in the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP) database [9]. Among these substances, as many as 343 polyketide derivatives (1–343) had been discovered and characterized from Aspergillus strains. To enrich our knowledge of these molecules and explore their therapeutic potentials, all aspects are well organized and comprehensively summarized in this review, including their biological sources, structural features, biological properties as well as biosynthetic logic. 2. Aspergillus-Derived Polyketides as Secondary Metabolites According to structural features, Aspergillus-derived polyketides are grouped into fourteen types, including benzophenone, diphenyl ether, furan and furanone, isocoumarin, lignan, naphthalene, phenolic, polyene, pyran and pyranone, quinone, steroid, meroterpenoid, xanthone and miscellaneous, which are respectively introduced below. Detailed information for these chemicals was summarized in Table S1. 2.1. benzophenones Benzophenone derivatives (Figure 1) are a class of ketones formed by the direct connection of one carbonyl with two phenyl groups and play an important role in medicinal J.

Under nitrogen-limiting culture conditions, strain A. nidulans FGSCA4 was found to produce a novel prenylated benzophenone pre-shamixanthone (1), which exerted significant inhibition against lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells without cytotoxic effect and displayed a potent reduction of total cholesterol and triglycerides [11,12]. Two new dichlorinated benzophenones 2 and 3 were purified from A. terreus C9408-3 [13], and the later compound is a promising immunosuppressant agent targeting the isomerase cyclophilin A (CyPA) [14]. Three benzophenone analogs (4–6) obtained from a wetland fungus A. flavipes PJ03-11 exhibited stronger α-glucosidase inhibitory activities than acarbose [15]. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOAc extract of one marine sponge-derived strain A. europaeus WZXY-SX-4-1 led to the isolation of eight benzophenone derivatives (7–14), of which compounds 9, 11, and 12 showed potent radical scavenging activity against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and 8 had strong down-regulation of NF-κB in LPSinduced SW480 cells [16]. Moreover, the putative biosynthetic pathway analysis indicates that endocrocin and emodin were their precursors through consecutive oxidation and methylation (Scheme 1). J.

Aspergillus-derived diphenyl ethers (15–31, Figure 2) consist of at least two phenyls connected by one or more oxygen atoms. These aromatic polyketides exhibited excellent potential for therapeutic and industrial applications [17].

Three spiro β-furanones, asperones C–E (87–89), are dimeric polyketides with two distinct skeletons from an unidentified stain Aspergillus sp. and compounds 87 and 88 showed significant nitric oxide (NO) inhibition in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 13.2 and 6.0 µM, respectively [51]. Six new C9 polyketides (90–95) were also produced by the marine strain A. ochraceus, and compound 94 exerted significant cytotoxic effects on the BV-2 cell line [34]. (+)-Geodin (96), originally derived from strain P. glabrum AJ117540 was produced by strain A. terreus ATCC 20542 and exhibited the activity that stimulates glucose uptake by rat adipocytes [56,57]. Asperetide (97) and (5)-3-butyl-7-methoxyphthalide (98) were purified from the medicinal plant-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. TJ23 [58]. In addition to gibellulins C (15) and D (16), three porriolide analogs (99–101) were manufactured by disruption of the global regulator LaeB in A. nidulans [18] and displayed an inhibitory effect on the root elongation of both lettuce and stone-leek seedlings by 53.3% and 48.5%, respectively [59,60]. 2.4. isocoumarins Aspergillus-derived isocoumarins (Figure 7) are a class of phenolic compounds usually containing hydroxyl group(s) and display various pharmacological properties, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic activities and inhibitory effects on serine protease and gamma-secretase [61–63]. Chemical investigation of an Indo-Pacific marine sponge-derived A. ochraceus afforded a new dihydroisocoumarin, (−)-(R)-mellein (102), which exhibited a broad spectrum of antifungal and antioomycetes activities [64]. One marine-derived strain A. ochraceus MA-15 was shown to produce four isocoumarin derivatives (103–106), of which compound 106 had inhibitory activity against aquatic pathogenic bacterial Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio anguillarum, and V. harveyi [44].

Pyrans Recently pyran derivatives received more and more attention due to their wide biological activities, including antibacterial and antifungal activities, and many of them have been developed as commercial antimicrobial agents, such as triadimefon, triadimenol, diniconazole, myclobutanil and bitertanol [100,101]. Azaphilones (189–193, Figure 12) are a class of highly oxygenated pyrano-quinone bicyclic chemicals from strain A. niger ATCC 1015 by activation of a silent PKS gene (aza) [102]. Moreover, their biosynthetic pathways were shown to involve the convergent actions of a highly reducing PKS and a non-reducing PKS. Citrinin (194) is a pyran mycotoxin produced by several strains of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Monascus. In addition to toxicity, this compound displayed certain anticancer and neuroprotective effects [103]. Five new benzopyran derivatives (195–199), including two pairs of enantiomers, were purified from the fermentation broth of A. fumigatus, an endophytic fungus associated with Cordyceps Sinensis. Compounds 195 and 197 exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on the MV4-11 cell line in vitro with IC50 values of 23.95 µM and 32.70 µM, respectively [104]. Two new C9 pyran polyketides, asperochratides I (200) and J (201), were isolated from the deep-sea-derived A. ochraceus but showed no cytotoxic, anti-food allergic, anti-H1N1 virus and anti-inflammatory activities [34].

By the heterologous expression of the avirulence gene ACE1 in A. oryzae M-2-3, two new polyenyl-α-pyranones (209 and 210) were produced and shown to be not responsible for the observed ACE1-mediated avirulence [105]. (+)-Asperlin (211) was discovered from an A. nidulans mutant, which fused the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor associated with a silent SM gene cluster with the activation domain of a robust SM transcription factor AfoA [106]. Deletion of the epigenetic regulator gene, a histone acetyltransferase in the SAGA/ADA complex, resulted in the production of a novel compound, nigerpyrone (212) in A. niger FGSC A1279 [107]. Moreover, its biosynthetic pathway was disclosed via gene knockout and complementation experiments (Scheme 4). Aspopyrone A (213) was produced by an Okinawan plant-derived fungus, A. sp. TMPU1623 exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B with an IC50 value of 6.7 µM [108]. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the crude extract of an endophytic strain, A. flocculus, resulted in the isolation of three pyranone analogs (214–216) [22]. 4- Hydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-2-pyrone (217) and 4-methyl-5,6-dihydropyran-2-one (218) were also produced by the marine strain A. sydowii SCSIO 41301 [33], and phomapyrone C (219) together with compounds 40, 176 and 215 was purified from strain SCSIO 41024 [35].

Anthraquinones Anthraquinones are a group of structurally diverse and biologically active natural products with therapeutic effects [112,113]. Several chemical studies suggested that the marine-derived fungus A. glaucus HB1-19 was a versatile producer of anthraquinone polyketides (230–242, Figure 15), which compounds 230 and 231 displayed potent cytotoxicities against A-549, HL-60, BEL-7402, and P388 cell lines and 241 and 242 had strong inhibitory effects on the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) c-Met, Ron, and c-Src with low-micromolar IC50 values [79,114,115]. In addition to the aromatic polyketide 151, substances 243–247 were obtained from the marine strain A. versicolor, and 243, 244, and 246 exhibited significant cytotoxicity against five human solid tumor cell lines (A-549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF-498, and HCT-15) with IC50 values in the range of 0.41–4.61 µg/mL and 243 and 246 also showed excellent antibacterial activity against several clinical Gram-positive strains with MIC values of 0.78–6.25 µg/mL [85]. Sanghaspirodins A (248) and B (249) were two novel antiproliferative agents from strain A. nidulans grown in a chemostat under nitrogen limitation [116]. Two anthraquinones (250 and 251) were synthesized by inducing the expression of the silent PKS gene in A. nidulans FGSCA4 under a continuous cultivation regime [117]. Compounds 252 and 253 were produced by the fumarole-derived strain A. terreus C9408-3 when cultured at 40 ◦C for 7 days on potato dextrose agar plates [13]. Dermolutein (254) and methylemodin (255), along with compounds 240 and 256–258, were purified from the EtOAc extract of A. europaeus WZXY-SX-4-1 and exerted remarkable down-regulation of NF-κB in LPS-induced SW480 cells [16]. By disruption of a global regulator LaeB in A. nidulans, a potent aggregation inhibitor asperthecin (259) was identified from a mutant by a filter trap assay and electron microscopy [118]. Versiconol B (260) together with three analogs (247, 261, 262) produced by strain A. sp. F40 showed weak antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus [90]. In addition to the common metabolite 234, compounds 263–267 were detected in the crude extracts of two marine strains A. sydowii SCSIO 41301 and A. terreus SCSIO 41008 [33,69], and 234, 264 and 265 exhibited broad inhibitory activities against H1N1 and H3N influenzas. Whereas strain A. versicolor HBU-2017-7-derived, two anthraquinones (268) and (269) showed no antibacterial or cytotoxic activity [119]. J. Fungi 2023, 9, 261 14 of 24 J.

By UHPLC-DAD-HRMS and dereplication, aculenes C and D (338 and 339) were isolated from a strain of A. aculeatus but showed weak antifungal activity [150]. Dehydrocurvularin (340) was a new lactone polyketide from strain A. terreus ATCC 20542 and acted as a prevalent fungal phytotoxin with heat shock response and immune-modulatory activities and a broad-spectrum inhibitor of various cancer cell lines in vitro [61,157,158].

Many of these substances or derivatives have therapeutic effects, such as the immunosuppressant agent (3), the antioxidant benzaldehydes (34,35), the α-glucosidase inhibitors (327–330), etc. Furthermore, the potential to discover novel polyketides from Aspergillus strains is still immense since a great number of their BGCs are shown to be inactive or unawakened under traditional culture conditions [159]. With the development and application of bioinformative tools and analytical techniques, more and more Aspergillus genomes, as well as functional genes, will be sequenced and annotated. These silent BGCs responsible for the biosynthesis of novel polyketides are being disclosed and activated using new strategies, such as the one strain many compounds (OSMAC) approach and genome mining combined with metabolic engineering [8,160,161]. In addition, the biosynthesis of polyketides from acyl-CoA thioesters J. Fungi 2023, 9, 261 18 of 24 is catalyzed by various PKSs, which structures of initiation and condensation domains provide valuable insights into the molecular factors governing starter unit selectivity and chain-length control. A detailed understanding of these PKS structural features controlling polyketide biosynthesis and modification offers a powerful tool for the controlled and rational design of novel polyketides through enzyme engineering. Therefore, more efforts should be made to employ biosynthetic engineering approaches to improve the efficient discovery of novel polyketides from the genus Aspergillus.
