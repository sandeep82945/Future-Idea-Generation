In most carbon dioxide (CO2) capture processes, chemical absorption using an amine solvent is widely used technology; however, the solvent is prone to solvent degradation and solvent loss which leads to the formation of corrosion. This paper investigates the adsorption performance of amine-infused hydrogels (AIFHs) to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) capture by leveraging the potency of amine absorption and adsorption properties of class F fly ash (FA). The solution polymerization method was used to synthesize the FA-grafted acrylic acid/acrylamide hydrogel (FA-AAc/AAm), which was then immersed in monoethanolamine (MEA) to form amine infused hydrogels (AIHs). The prepared FA-AAc/AAm showed dense matrices morphology with no obvious pore at the dry state but capable of capturing up to 0.71 mol/g CO2 at 0.5 wt% FA content, 2 bar pressure, 30 ◦C reaction temperature, 60 L/min flow rate, and 30 wt% MEA contents. Cumulative adsorption capacity was calculated and Pseudo-first order kinetic model was used to investigate the CO2 adsorption kinetic at different parameters. Remarkably, this FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel is also capable of absorbing liquid activator that was 1000% more than its original weight. FA-AAc/AAm can be used as an alternative AIHs that employ FA waste to capture CO2 and minimize the GHG impact on the environment. 1. introduction One of the world’s key focus is to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact on climate resilience and environmental sustainability. GHG such as CO2 accumulate in the atmosphere and cause climate change by trapping heat. The main GHG emission contributors are the transport, manufacturing industries, industrial processes, waste, agriculture sector and energy industries. As of July 2022, statistics from Global Energy Monitor shows there are more than 2215 power plants that actively generate electricity from the burning of coal [1]. A conventional post-combustion capture technology (PCC) used in plants normally utilize amine as the absorbent solvent that binds with CO2. Amine as a solvent is generally used for the removal of CO2 as it has a faster rate of reaction with CO2. However, the main problem related to the use of amine as a solvent for the CO2 absorption is its high cost [2]. The high cost is associated with its regeneration cost which results in only 50% of the solvent at the end. Another problem with amine solvent is it affects operating problems such as solvent degradation, solvent loss and corrosion to the equipment [3]. Adsorption is an appealing method because it requires little energy to regenerate and is easy to process. However, it has limitations when used in high moisture environments and at low pressure conditions, which can affect its capacity and selectivity [4,5]. To improve its performance, amine-functionalized adsorbents were introduced. Amine-functionalized adsorbents are prepared by attaching amines to a porous support, either through in situ Gels 2023, 9, 229. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9030229 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels Gels 2023, 9, 229 2 of 16 formed polymeric amines or impregnation route. Impregnated route adsorbent is created by physically adsorbing amines onto the support, while amine-grafted/covalently bonded systems are made through chemical reaction during synthesis or post-synthesis modification [4]. For instance, Chen et al. (2017) employed a post-functionalization technique to introduce amines into silica and observed that the CO2 adsorption capacity remained stable even after 10 cycles of adsorption [6]. Liu et al. (2019) developed a thermosensitive solid amine CO2 adsorbent by grafted polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) via inverse suspension polymerization and it recorded 3.15 mmol/g of CO2 adsorption at 10 ◦C under wet condition [5]. Similarly, Choi et al. (2022) employed the in-situ method to bond hyperbranched poly(amidoamine)s on the ethylenediamine via oil-water-oil suspension polymerization and successfully formed microporous hydrogel particles that exhibited a CO2 adsorption capacity of 104.4 mg/g from flue gas in its dry state. The average pore size of the particles also varies from 2.9 µm to 1.3 µm depending on the agitation speed [7]. In another study, Kim et al. (2021) physically impregnated MEA into the dried hydrogel, resulting in an amine infused hydrogel (AIHs) with increased CO2 selectivity in the methane/CO2 mixture gas system compared to bulk MEA solution [8]. White et al. (2021) also utilized the same method to infused the amine into the hydrogel and investigated the use of water and ethylene glycol (EG) as the amine solvent in order to increase the uptake kinetic and minimize solvent degradation after adsorbent recycling. The study found that a combination of EG-diethanolamine resulted in a CO2 capture capacity of 0.75 mol CO2 per mol amine and that the adsorption capacity of the AIHs was highly dependent on the type of hydrogel used, with poly(acrylamide) found to be more effective in capturing CO2 compared to poly(N-2-hydroxythyleneacrylamide) and sodium polyacrylate [9]. Hydrogels, as a solid support, possess unique characteristics such as the ability to retain high amounts of liquid while maintaining their structural integrity through chemical or physical crosslinking of the polymer chains [10]. In order to exploit its potential as a CO2 adsorbent, the properties of hydrogels can be manipulated by infusing amine solvents into the hydrogel matrix. This AIHs can be prepared through the impregnation route, which is a simple and efficient process that reduces both operation time and capital costs [11]. The AIHs act as microcontainers when CO2 molecules diffuse through the surface of the hydrogel and react with the amine solution in-situ. This interaction with CO2 results in the formation of carbamates or bicarbonates. The AIHs exhibit a combination of physical adsorption inherited from the parent adsorbent and chemical adsorption from the loaded amine groups, resulting in a much higher CO2 adsorption capacity when compared to separate microcontainers and bulk amines [12]. Additionally, the use of AIHs technology eliminates the need for extra packing materials, as the hydrogel itself serves as the “amine storage and packing” [11]. The utilization of solid support mechanisms in the development of gas adsorbents to minimize the drawback of amine solvent has been a topic of ongoing research for an extended period of time [13–18]. However, the use of power plant generated waste, specifically fly ash (FA) as an additive in polymer adsorbents to enhance gas adsorption properties, has not been widely explored in the research literature. Previous FA adsorbent studies primarily focused on the surface treatment of the FA itself and it was proven that chemically treated FA did improve the surface area, morphology, porosity, and adsorbent affinity of fly ash [19]. The enhancement of CO2 adsorption by FA can been done via various methods such as alkaline activator treatment [20,21], conversion of FA into zeolite [22,23] and impregnation of raw FA using amine such as MEA [24]. For instance, this solid waste was transformed into mesoporous adsorbent called silica-alumina composite aerogel with 400 m2/g of active surface area and 1.9 cm3/g of specific pores volume via alkaline fusion and acid leached method of FA. It able to adsorb 2.02 mmol/g of CO2 [25] compared to the pristine FA which only can capture CO2 up to 870.1 µmol/g FA [20]. FA is the coal power plant byproduct that trapped at the end of the process using precipitator or baghouse [26]. It contains high carbon content, silica dioxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) that can Gels 2023, 9, 229 3 of 16 facilitate the CO2 adsorption [20]. Within the last 20 years, an average quantity of 64.8 Mts FA was produced every year by the coal power plant in United State (US) and the highest utilization of FA was only at 60% which is in 2017 [27]. In this work, newly explored FA grafted AIHs was fabricated via direct impregnation of MEA in FA grafted AAc/AAm hydrogel. The impact of FA content, type of hydrogel activator, and operational temperature on CO2 capture was systematically evaluated in order to maximize the CO2 adsorption capacity. To gain a deeper understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanism of MEA-infused FA grafted AAc/AAm hydrogels, adsorption kinetic model analysis was performed using five different kinetic models. The results of this work suggest that the utilization of FA to enhance the adsorption properties of amine-infused hydrogels is a promising area for future investigation. 2. results and discussion  2.1. characterization of materials 2.1.1. Fly Ash Characterization Table 1 presents the chemical composition of FA. The composition of FA varies depending on the source of the FA. In this study, the coal FA that obtained from local power station recorded the chemical composition of silicon oxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) were 78.58 wt%, which indicated that the currently used FA was classified as a Class F FA as described in ASTM C618. The Class F FA contains more than 70% of Al2O3, SiO2 and less than 10% of CaO. While some analysis reported that the composition of SiO2 and Al2O3 can be up to 55% and 35% respectively [28,29]. The properties of the FA are highly dependent on its composition especially silicon (Si). High amount of silicon is able to contribute to high mechanical strength and adsorption capacity of the synthesized material [30,31]. On the other hand, the FA will be categorized as Class C if the total of Al2O3, SiO2 and ferrite is less or equal to 50% of the total FA composition and the composition of CaO is more than 10% [29]. Figure 1 shows the particle size distribution of raw FA. The particle size distribution of the FA was measured by the laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The particle size of FA ranged from 0.55 to 440 µm with median, D50 of 15.37 µm, D90 90% of the particles size was 122.95 µm and span of 7.82. According to Nath et al., the size of filler is one of the most important factors that might affect the mechanical properties of the composite materials. Frequently, nanofiller with a size of 2 nm to 50 nm was used in synthesizing the composite hydrogel [32–34]. Large-sized filler might create a weak point in the material [35]. Several reports found to utilize raw FA in its pristine state without grinding and sieving [35,36]. 2.1.2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Figure 2a shows the FTIR spectrum of FA. The broadband between 3718.99 to 2731.43 cm−1 is attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration –OH, suggesting the presence of an amorphous silicate material or possibly hydrated aluminum silicates. The band at 1627.24 cm−1 is due to the bending mode of H2O molecules. A strong and broadband between 1548.96 to 823.20 cm−1 is due to Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching vibration. The absorbance bands at 789.41 and 473.97 cm−1 represent Si-O-Al bending vibration of octahedral Al and bending of Si–O, respectively. The spectra of raw FA is comparable to the previous studies [37,38]. Gels 2023, 9, 229 4 of 16Gels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 16 2.1.2.

The absorbance bands at 789.41 and 473.97 cm−1 represent Si-O-Al bending vibration of octahedral Al and bending of Si–O, respectively. The spectra of raw FA is comparable to the previous studies [37,38]. Referring to Figure 2b, the additional FA in 0.5FA-AAc/AAm can be validated by observing the disappearance of C=C bending at 1100 and 936 cm−1. This can be used to presume that FA was successfully grafted into the AAc/AAm hydrogel. The IR spectra of 0.5FA-AAc/AAm+CO2 also displayed a few key differences at 1540 and 1320 cm−1 which correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric COO– stretching vibration. The presence of COO– stretching indicates the carbamate formation as an outcome from the reaction be- tween MEA and CO2. Thus, this means that CO2 molecules could readily penetrate hydro- gel and react with the infused MEA. Similar IR spectra with similar bands were observed in previous study by Xu et al. using DEA Infused Hydrogels (AIH) for CO2 capture [11]. Several common peaks were also observed between the AAc/AAm and 0.5FA- AAc/AAm+CO2 resulted from the use of copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylamide. Broad transmittance bands between 3600 cm−1 and 2750 cm−1 were assigned to -OH stretching which were originated by the hydroxyl group from carboxylic acid of acrylic acid. At 1650 cm−1, the common stretching of C=O groups were observed for both spectra. These align peaks were assigned to C=O group connected to the amide group of acrylamides. Figure 2.

The fitting calculation was carried out on the cumulative adsorption of the sample 30 wt% MEA infused 0.5FA-AAc/AAm which was performed at reaction temperature of 30 °C, CO2 gauge pressure of 2 bar and gas flow rate of 60 mL/min. The experimental and fitting results are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that from Table 2, the correlation coefficients, R2 of the pseudo-second order and Elovich kinetic model are 0.9905 and 0.9644, respectively. Meanwhile, the R2 of the Weber-Morris kinetic model is 0.8687. These kinetic models show relatively low R2 compared to pseudo-first order and Avrami kinetic model, so it is not fit to explain the kinetic behavior of 30 wt% MEA infused 0.5FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel. The Avrami kinetic model demonstrated a very close degree of correlation with the pseudo-first order kinetic model, as evidenced by R2 values of 0.9996 and 0.9999, respectively. However, on top of R2 analysis, other statistical indicators that represent residual error like SSE must be ana- lyzed to validate the modelling [40]. Thus, upon analysis of the sum of squared estimate errors (SSE), it was determined that the pseudo-first order model was the most appropri- ate for describing the adsorption kinetics of CO2 by a 30 wt% MEA-infused 0.5FA- AAc/AAm hydrogel.

However, further increases in FA content led to a decline in adsorption capacity, with values of 0.57 mol/g and 0.39 mol/g for 1.0 and 2.0 wt% of FA, respectively.

However, further increases in FA content led to a decline in adsorption capacity, with values of 0.57 mol/g and 0.39 mol/g for 1.0 and 2.0 wt% of FA, respec ively. The kinetic constants for 0FA, 0.5FA, 1.0FA and 2.0FA-MEA infused hydrogel were determined at 1.54 min−1, 0.76 min−1, 1.01 min−1, and 1.41 min−1 respectively. The use of aluminosilicate bentonite in ethylcellulose in study by Alekseeva et al. (2020) also demonstrated a similar Gels 2023, 9, 229 8 of 16 trend where the adsorption kinetic rate increased as the FA content increased, despite a decline in adsorption capacity [41].

Effect of AAc/AAm Hydrogel Activator Hydrogel is a versatile material that exhibits unique properties such as shrinkage, swelling, and the ability to retain large amounts of liquids. The activation of the hydrogel, through the infusion of a liquid solution, causes the material to swell and expand. This swelling results in the creation of additional void spaces within the hydrogel matrix and imbuing it with additional properties based on the properties of infused liquid [43]. The swelling properties of the hydrogel are highly affected by the ionic strength, pH and tem- perature.

FA is an aluminosilicate mineral, which means it consists primarily of silica, aluminum, iron and calcium oxide [42] and has the capability to adsorb CO2 [20]. In general, incorporating a nanocomposite or fi ler into a polymer adsorbent i creases porosity compared to the eat polym r.

As shown in Figure 8a,b, at temperature of 30 °C, pressure of 2 bar and flowrate of 60 mL/min, the CO2 adsorption capacity of water infused 0.5FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel was 0.51 mol/g. A further analysis of the kinetic model revealed that the pseudo-first order kinetic rate increases in the following order: 30 wt% MEA < water < 100 wt% MEA, with values of 0.76 min−1, 0.96 min−1, and 0.98 min−1, respectively, as demonstrated in Figure 8c and summarized in Table 3.

Gels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16 Gels 2023, 9, 229 10 of 16 Water exhibited a comparable adsorption capacity to the 100 wt% MEA infused hydrogel. 1 mol of diffused CO2 can react with 1 mol of hydroxyl groups to form carbonic acid (shown in Equation (1)), and 1 mol of amine (C2H7NO) can only react with 0.5 mol of CO2 (shown in Equation (2)), but the nitrogen atom in amine molecules is more electronegative and attractive towards CO2. Despite the high adsorption of water creating more void within the hydrogel adsorbent, the use of amine as the activator was found to be more effective in adsorbing CO2, supported by the slightly higher kinetic rate of the 100 wt% MEA-infused hydrogel. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that pure amine infused hydrogel would be more efficient in capturing CO2 than one infused with water. Meanwhile, the adsorption capacity shows a significant increment with the use of 30 wt% of MEA solution. It also can be inferred that an increase in the concentration of MEA leads to an increase in the kinetic rate, indicating a faster reaction with CO2. However, with the presence of water in amine solution, 1 mol of MEA now can react with 1 mol of CO2 and form bicarbonate, as shown in Equation (3), resulting higher CO2 adsorption capacity.

Effect of Operational Temperature A series of adsorption experiments were investigated in fixed bed column at 30, 45 and 60 ◦C. Figure 9 shows the breakthrough curve and adsorption capacity of 0.5FA-AAc/AAm at three different operational temperature. It shows that the higher adsorption temperature, the shorter the break curve and saturation time. At adsorption temperature of 30 ◦C, the CO2 adsorption amount of 0.5FA-AAc/AAm was 0.71 mol/g. However, it decreased to 0.53 and 0.49 mol/g at 45 and 60 ◦C, respectively. From the Table 3, it can see that the kinetic constant, k1 increases from 0.76 min−1 to 1.14 min−1 as the adsorption temperature increase from 30 ◦C to 60 ◦C, indicating that the increase in temperature promotes the reaction rate. In general, as temperature increases, the kinetic energy of gas particles also increases, leading to more frequent collisions between gas and adsorbent molecules and resulting in a higher adsorption capacity. Conversely, the reaction rate and CO2 equilibrium adsorption capacity were inversely proportional to each other. At temperatures above 60 ◦C, thermodynamic effect become more significant in controlling the reaction compared to kinetic effect, and the carbamate molecules begin to reverse back to CO2 as shows in Equation (14), resulted the decrease in equilibrium adsorption capacity [5,25].

Figure 9. (a) Breakthrough adsorption curves, (b) equilibrium adsorption capacity and (c) pseudo- first order fitted adsorption capacity at different adsorption temperature (pressure = 2 bar, CO2 flowrate = 60 mL/min). The CO2 adsorption of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel in this study varied from 0.39 to 0.71 mol/g depending on the FA content, type of hydrogel activator and operational temperature. It is noted that the use of different amine, starting monomer, filler or polymerization technique will give different properties to the adsorbent. For instance, MEA-hydrogel with the dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) surfactant showed an adsorption of 2.96 mmol/g [8]. Meanwhile, silica that functionalize with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) via wet grafting method able to capture CO2 up to 1.67 mmol/g [45]. Another example of amine infused adsorbent is APTES functionalized aluminosilicate; which came from metakaolin and silica fume. The study successfully absorbed 1.17 mmol/g of CO2 and the adsorbent also exhibited low adsorption and desorption energy of 14.47 and 51.05 kJ/mol [46]. The concept of incorporating amine in solid adsorbent has been established for some time, but the search for the best adsorbent in term of sorption capacity, industrial pliability and sustainable for a long run should be continue with more material to be explored. 3. conclusions The FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel was synthesized via in-situ solution polymerization and hydrogel activator was infused by direct impregnation method in which the hydrogel was immersed in the water or MEA solution for 24 h. The morphology of the hydrogel featured less visible pores but demonstrated a high capacity for hydrogel activator absorption. It is suggested that the amine absorption properties of the hydrogel are also influenced by the functional groups present. The incorporation of fly ash into AIHs was found to effectively improve CO2 adsorption. At a temperature of 30 ◦C and pressure of 2 bar, the use of 0.5 wt% of FA increased CO2 adsorption by 54% compared to neat AIHs. Data from this study were best simulated by the pseudo-first order > Avrami fractional > pseudo-second order > Elovich > Weber-Morris kinetic models, as supported by the SSE value. It can be inferred that the rate of change in CO2 uptake with respect to time is directly proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the amount of solid uptake. However, the Avrami fractional kinetic model cannot be completely disregarded due to only 0.99% difference in SSE between both kinetic models. Although the hydrogel material is stable at high temperature up to 380 ◦C, the breakthroughs analysis suggest that the adsorption of CO2 is not favorable at high temperatures. As a result, to optimize the adsorption capacity of the amine infused FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel, it is recommended to lower the flue gas temperature prior to the adsorption. Further optimization studies, such as varying the FA composition, FA particle size, type of amine solution, operational pressure, and increasing Gels 2023, 9, 229 12 of 16 temperature, are also recommended in order to maximize CO2 capture. 4. material and methods  4.1. materials Acrylamide (analytical reagent grade) and acrylic acid (99% purity) were supplied by Merck.
