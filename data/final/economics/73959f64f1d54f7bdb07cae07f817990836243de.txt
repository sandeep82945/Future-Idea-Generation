Received Aug 31, 2021 Revised Aug 03, 2022 Accepted Aug 18, 2022 In mitigating the peak demand, the energy authority in Malaysia has introduced the enhanced time of use (EToU). However, the number of participants joining the programs is less than expected. Due to that reason, this study investigated the investment benefit in terms of electricity cost reduction when consumers subscribe to the EToU tariff scheme. The significant consumers from industrial tariff types have been focused on where the load profiles were collected from the incoming providers’ power stations. Meanwhile, ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are applied to optimize the load profiles reflecting EToU tariff prices. The proposed method had shown a reduction in electricity cost, and the most significant performance has been recorded congruently. For a maximum 30% load adjustment using ACO optimization, the electricity costs have been decreased by 10% (D type of tariff), 16% (E1 type of tariff), 9% (E2 kind of tariff), and 1.13% (E3 type of tariff) when compared to the existing conventional tariff. The cost-benefit of the EToU tariff switching has been identified where the simple payback period (SPP) is below one year for all the industrial types of consumers. 1. introduction The increasing electricity demand contributes to energy generation to increase CO2 gas emissions. In recent data founding, it was reported that 84% of CO2 emissions are contributed by industrial/manufacturing activities [1], [2]. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic promotes lockdown among energy consumers, CO2 emissions are reduced in line with the energy demand decreased from the industry sectors. However, the long-term and economic benefits in terms of demand-side management (DSM) should be considered so that future planning would consider the economic and financial aspects of many related consumers programs towards load management [3]. Thus, DSM programs should be introduced to reduce the impact of peak demand and the power system generation tension; the demand response program and energy efficiency for the post pandemic COVID-19 [4]. In 2022, there has been an upsurge in electricity peak demand in Malaysia since the colossal development and industrial process are restarted to operate where electricity tariff switching is available. Since 1995, the government has purposely implemented the time of use (ToU) tariff scheme to commercial and industrial consumers by promoting the load shifting where the energy price for off-peak hours is cheaper for about 20% compared to the flat tariff price. However, the ToU

scheme has a maximum demand charge that is still high compared to the conventional flat tariff. Concerning the issue, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) has introduced a more advanced tariff, namely the enhanced time of used (EToU) tariff scheme, in 2016. The EToU tariff scheme offers a more flexible tariff time zone with three energy prices for peak, off-peak, and mid-peak and two prices for maximum demand in peak and mid-peak allocation. Nevertheless, it was reported that only 1% of the consumers joined the scheme. Meanwhile, the others refused to participate due to being less confident to apply the load management strategies [5]. It is also related to the provider’s less promotion where the consumers have little knowledge of how to take load management action. Since there, the researchers have investigated the issues and tried to help the consumers by proposing
the techniques required to enjoy cost benefits from the EToU tariff scheme. As presented in [6], [7], industrial and commercial consumers’ load profile was investigated to reflect the EToU tariff scheme compared to the ToU tariff. As for standard load shifting implementation, the consumers need to adjust the load for about ~30 to 70% to enjoy energy consumption cost reduction compared to flat and ToU tariff schemes. Since the application of the evolutionary algorithm is excellent in solving many complex problems, especially in power system study, Azman et al. [7] have promoted the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to find the optimum load profile for specific commercial consumers by adopting EToU tariff prices. The energy consumption cost was reduced at all six-segmentation zones of the peak, mid-peak, and off-peak when the load adjustment was put for about 50%. The optimum load management weightage differed depending on the consumers’ load profile and the business activities dealing with the cost reduction under the EToU tariff scheme, as explained in [8]. The authors have adopted particle swarm optimization (PSO) to manage the simultaneous DSM strategies formulation (peak clipping, valley filling, and load shifting) to deal with six-segments of EToU tariff price. In conjution to the DSM technique application to deal with ToU tariff design around the world,
Rehman et al. [9] and Makroum et al. [10] has applied the load shifting from high-peak hours to low-peak hours concurrently with the adoption of optimization algorithms, namely bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and genetic algorithm (GA). As the application of the optimization algorithm is superior results, analysis of the effect of ToU tariff and maximum demand on the power exchange of the power grid can be done strategically [11], [12]. Ultimately, in [13], the optimization algorithm and optimal DSM strategy formulation to reflect the EToU tariff scheme have been used to optimize the load profile to reduce the electricity price and maximum demand in peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, Shaari et al. [14] use EToU tariff and ToU tariff prices for a chiller plant operation to optimize the cost of the process. As the significant energy user in most commercial buildings, the chiller plant operation electricity cost optimization would benefit private consumers and government agencies. In the EToU tariff scheme study, the optimization algorithm’s application was less focused on past
studies, mainly for implementing the optimal DSM strategy to the specific consumers. Meanwhile, the cost-benefit of the investment to switch the conventional tariff to EToU tariff has also less been presented in the area of study. Therefore, this study proposed an investigation of the cost-benefit under the EToU tariff scheme, which applies the ant colony optimization (ACO) and PSO algorithms while reflecting load management strategy under the demand response program in Malaysia. ACO algorithm is famously known to be a probabilistic algorithm used to find an approximately optimal solution through an ant colony-inspired process [15]. Artificial ants or simulation agents search for the most straightforward solution by moving through parameter space. The agents record their location and solutions that will later be spread to other agents to find the best solutions among all of the information gathered [16]. ACO is selected in this study because it performs a model-based search and is similar to estimating distribution algorithm [17]. In conjunction with that, the PSO introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [18] will be the baseline performance algorithm to compare with ACO algorithm performance. Those comparisons purposely test the load profile from all categories under the industrial tariff offered by TNB in peninsular Malaysia. Since the simultaneously DSM strategies have been applied by previous studies for commercial buildings, investigating appropriateness to industrial consumers is essential to prove that the EToU tariff scheme could be used by massive segmentation of industrial consumers. Hence, the paper’s arrangement is considered as: section 2 presents the formulation and tariff structure
methodology while covering the implementation of the PSO and ACO algorithms. Next, the simulation case study, results, and discussion are presented in section 3. Meanwhile, section 4 concludes the findings and recommendations for future research. 2. research method  2.1. load management formulation EToU tariff is in the pricing unit.

The application of both algorithms is describing in the following sections. 2.2. ant colony optimization Ant colony optimization algorithm is an optimization technique used to solve problems through
graphs. This optimization method is developed based on the behavior of a colony of ants. The paradigm used in this optimization is based on the communication of biological ants through pheromone-based communication [19], [20]. The ants travel in search of food and leave trails of pheromones and attract other ants to follow the trails, which is why ants always travel in a line. The more pheromones laid out on the path, more ants will follow the path, and that path will be the best solution to the problem faced. In the ACO algorithm, two processes are involved: generating the ants process and updating the pheromones process. A new set of ants will be generated in each iteration respective to the desired nodes in the first process. The probability of ant to select a node is expressed in (15). p(αij|Sp)= rij α×η ij

Where, 𝑝(𝛼𝑖𝑗|𝑆𝑝) is the probability that the limit 𝛼𝑖𝑗 will be selected in with the partial solution 𝑆𝑝, 𝛼𝑖𝑗 is the node 𝑖 to node 𝑗 limit. The 𝑟𝑖𝑗 is the 𝛼𝑖𝑗 pheromone values. The 𝜂𝑖𝑗 is a heuristic value, or the inverse of the cost of going through limit 𝛼𝑖𝑗. Meanwhile, 𝛼 is the importance factor of pheromone and 𝛽 is the importance factor of heuristic. After the trails have been updated after the ants have completed their solution, updating pheromone
process will start. In this process, the level of shifted pheromone is determined. The escalating value of pheromone in trails leave by ants will restrain the connecting nodes it has used. There are also cases of decreasing pheromone level due to evaporation process. In (16) and (17) presents the process of updating pheromone evaporation and reinforcement accordingly. rij=(1-ρ)×rij (16)
Where, 𝑟𝑖𝑗 is the value pheromone at the limit ranging from i to j. 𝜌 is the pheromone evaporation factor
rij=rij+ ∑ ∆rij (17)
Where ∑ ∆𝑟𝑖𝑗 is the pheromone that will be added by an ant to the trail, that rely on the length of the trail that used by the ants. There four steps for ACO algorithm that has been applied to this study are: − Step 1: ants are initialized by setting 𝛼 = 1, 𝛽 = 0 and 𝜌 = 0.3 referred to [21], [22]and [23]. The ants expressing a possible initial load profile set to identify each electricity energy cost change or the
algorithm are called nodes in 24-hour time. In the next step, the fitness values obtained is used. TELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control

− Step 2: the constraints is formulated, and the cost is identified. The pheromone values that have been updated will be engaged in the EToU formulation in form of MD cost and the DSM strategy as in (2) until (12)
accordingly. The best cost value in the first process in ACO is chosen from the latest update of total electricity cost in six-time segmentation. The second process of finding the updated ants’ pheromones will start after the first process of ACO is done. − Step 3: the best cost value obtained during updating the pheromones are used to determine the best total energy cost covering all segmentations, while the ideal load profile represented by the best ants is
developed. Once again, (16) and (17) are applied in this step. − Step 4: after the requirements for the best cost have been achieved, to satisfy the constraints, the achieved value of cost is concluded to be convergence value. If the condition is not yet fulfilled, the process will
begin all over again to find the new possible setting of ants list. In this step, the contribution of electricity energy cost and MD cost to the assistance of LFI is generated. 2.3. particle swarm optimization PSO is a method that optimizes a problem by repeatedly trying to improve already existing
candidate solutions. This optimization algorithm is inflicted by animal movement such as a colony of bats and school of fish [24], [25]. PSO algorithm solves the problem by letting a swarm of particles moves freely inside the search space to search for the best position. Each particle updated its best positions found in the space attracting other particles, thus generating a swarm of particles. The equation used to find the updated particle’s velocity and position is (18) and (19), respectively. Vj k+1=(ω×Vj k)+ (C1r1(Pbestj k -Xj k)) + (C2r2(Gbestj k -Xj k)) (18)
Xj k+1=Xj k+Vj k+1 (19)
Where, 𝑉𝑗 𝑘 is the particle 𝑗 velocity in 𝑘 iteration, 𝑋𝑗 𝑘 is the particle 𝑗 position in 𝑘 iteration, and 𝜔 is the inertia weightage. Meanwhile, 𝑃𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑗 𝑘 is the fitness function best value that has been obtained by particle 𝑗 in 𝑘 iteration, and 𝐺𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑗 𝑘 is the best value between the fitness values, The 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 are the constants that presenting weightage factor of random acceleration terms, 𝑉𝑗 𝑘+1 is the updated velocity, and 𝑋𝑗 𝑘+1 is the updated position. The steps used by PSO algorithm in this study to determine the optimal electricity cost is:
− Step 1: population is initialized using daily load profile based 24-hour to represent consumers’ power consumption shape. A random generator in the program produces the variables throughout the system to
evaluate the electricity usage cost for the load profile in the next step. PSO parameters like number of particles 𝑁, weighting factor, 𝐶1 and 𝐶2, and maximum number of iterations are initialized. The constant parameters such as the social and cognitive coefficients were set at 1.0, and the initial weight coefficient was set at 0.2. The maximum inertia, minimum inertia, and the number of iterations were set at 0.9, 0.1, and 1000. Optimization is conserves and all constraints in (2) until (14) are applied to achieve the ideal electricity usage cost. − Step 2: calculation of fitness. An initial population of particles that have random positions and velocities are generated randomly. The load profile will be analyzed, the total EToU electricity energy cost and
MD cost is calculated with (2) by using correlation from the (3), (4) and (12) at once for each particle that satisfy the constraints in step 1. Meanwhile, the input of calculation and constraints are used to calculate LFI referred to (14). − Step 3: determination of 𝑃𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 and 𝐺𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 . During the exploring phase, the two finest values are listed. The values recorded are correlated with the best solution that has been widen so far by each particle that
maintain the path of its position in the space. Pbest and Gbest presenting the generation of finest EToU energy consumption expenses which also has contributed to generate optimum MD cost. − Step 4: updating velocity and position. The particles’ velocity and position are updated by applying (18) and (19) accordingly. The new particle’s velocity represents a load profile curve change. For the time being,
the new particle’s position used to evaluate the total load profile in all segmentations. If the convergences will occur with this new position set and if the convergence is not fulfilled, the process will repeat all over again. 3. results and discussion  3.1. case study The arrangement of the case study that has been set for this project is as:
− Case 1: baseline of the flat/ToU tariff rates. − Case 2: EToU tariff rate energy consumption without DSM strategies and without optimization algorithms. − Case 3: EToU tariff rate energy consumption without DSM strategies and using optimization algorithms. ISSN: 1693-6930

− Case 4: EToU tariff rate energy consumption using 10% of the DSM strategies and optimization algorithms. − Case 5: EToU tariff rate energy consumption using 20% of the DSM strategies and optimization algorithms. − Case 6: EToU tariff rate energy consumption using 30% of the DSM strategies and optimization algorithms. Industrial D (consumers with low voltage 415 V with flat tariff) and E1 (consumers with medium voltage
11/33 kV with flat tariff) load profiles as the baseline; meanwhile, Industrial E2 (consumers with medium voltage 11/33 kV with ToU tariff) and E3 (consumers with high voltage 132 kV with ToU tariff) load profiles as the baseline. In addition, the load weightage of DSM strategies has been set to 10%, 20%, and 30% as the load management weightage. 3.2. analysis of load profile using aco algorithm The output simulation of energy power consumption for all six cases using ACO is shown in Figure 1
accordingly. Figure 1(a) shows that after implementing DSM strategies and the ACO algorithm, the power consumption of all four load profiles for 24-hours operation decreased. The power consumption can be seen falling the most at case 6 for both medium voltage consumers E1 and E2 as shown in Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c), respectively. This is because most of the usage during peak hours and mid-peak hours from 8:00 am until 21:00 pm has been reduced, which means it has been shifted to off peak hours from 10:00 pm until 7:00 am. The results shown that ACO algorithm with the help of load management strategies has able to reduce
the energy consumptions during peak hours. It reflects the load management strategies applied: load clipping, valley filling, and load shifting. From the Figure 1(d), it can be observed that the load shifting, and peak clipping strategies have successfully decreased the electricity power consumption during the peak time. However, meanwhile in off-peak and mid-peak, the power consumption increases due to load shifting and valley filling impact. It has shown that DSM strategies applied are efficient and industrial customers especially E3 tariff type can indeed manage their load using this weightage adjustment method.

209 3.3. analysis of load profile using pso algorithm The output simulation of energy power consumption for all six cases using the PSO algorithm is
shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2(a), after implementing DSM strategies and PSO algorithm, the power consumption for 24-hours operation was also decreasing same as ACO power consumption outputs. Industrial D tariff power consumptions not only decreasing during peak hours but for overall 24-hours. PSO algorithms are more effective in reducing the energy consumptions for medium voltage of consumers E1 and E2 industrials tariff in the peak zones as illustrated by Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) accordingly. Meanwhile, Figure 2(d) shows the differences between the baseline of case 1 to the 30% weight arrangement of case 6 are significant for high voltage consumers (E3). 3.4. comparison of optimum performance Table 1 presents the optimization output performance for industrial D data. From the table, after
the ACO optimization and 30% load adjustment, the energy consumption decreasing by 12%, the total cost decreasing by 19% and the maximum demand was shifted to mid-peak. Meanwhile, for PSO algorithm, the energy consumption have been reducing by 26%, the total cost decreasing by 40% and the MD also has been shifted to mid-peak. From the analysis, PSO has shown better performance in reducing energy consumption. Table 2 presents the optimization output performance for industrial E1 data. From the table, after the ACO optimization and 30% load adjustment, the energy consumption decreasing by 2%, the total cost decreasing by 16% and the maximum demand was shifted to mid-peak. Meanwhile, for the PSO algorithm, the energy consumption has been decreasing by 15%, the total cost decreasing by 47%, and the MD has also been shifted to mid-peak. It can be concluded that for the industrial E1 load profile, PSO algorithm has better performance in reducing the energy consumption and the overall energy cost. Table 3 presents the optimization output performance for industrial E2 data. From the table, after the
optimizations of both algorithms with 30% load adjustment, there is an increment in energy consumption. ISSN: 1693-6930
TELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control, Vol. 21, No. 1, February 2023: 203-213

Still, the increment does not exceed the total energy constraint as mentioned earlier, which is ± 5%. Although there are increments in the total energy consumption, the total electricity cost for ACO and PSO algorithms decreases by 9% and 15%, respectively. Thus, the PSO algorithm reduces the total electricity cost than the ACO algorithm for the E2 load profile. Table 4 presents the optimization output performance for industrial E3 data. From the table, after the optimizations of both algorithms with 30% load adjustment, there is an increment in energy consumption. Still, the increment does not exceed the total energy constraint as mentioned earlier, which is ± 5%. Therefore, although there are increments in the total energy consumption, the total electricity cost for ACO and PSO algorithms decreases by 1.13% and 3%, respectively. 3.5. cost-benefit shows the items that need to be paid by customers who wish to switch to EToU tariff, including the recharge job order (RJO) by TNB, sub-meters installation, energy monitoring system controller, and the display unit. The price in the tables is referred from TNB and energy monitoring traders in Peninsular Malaysia excluding goods and 6% service tax. The total investments after summing all of the item costs are MYR 56,600. To know whether the investments made by the customers to change from previous tariff to EToU tariff is worth it, two calculations can be done: simple payback period and internal rate of return. Table 6 presents the simple payback period calculated for E1, E2, and E3 load profiles. Industrial D
load profile is not considered because the analysis done before shows that industrial D should use the flat tariff to enjoy more savings. From the table, industrial E3 has the most prolonged payback period due to the enormous cost of electricity bills. Nevertheless, the payback period for all industrial load profiles is less than one year, which means customers will get back their investment in less than one year.

211 4. conclusion The electricity cost has been successfully reduced by applying the simultaneous demand side strategies and implementing the optimization of ACO and PSO algorithms. The proposed simultaneous DSM strategies have shifted the peak usage of industrial D, E1, E2, and E3 load profiles to off-peak zones based on the six-segmentation of EToU electricity tariff. The valley filling strategies have changed the load profile load curve by filling in the off-peak zones. The load clipping and load shifting have successfully reduced the peak consumptions and shift them to off-peak zones. As a result, the maximum demand in the baseline cases has been shifted to mid-peak zones, contributing to the decrease in electricity bill cost. Other than that, the performance of optimization algorithms, ACO, and PSO has been analyzed, and the ability to handle the energy load profile makes it easier for the optimization process. PSO algorithms were found more efficient in reducing the price of electricity while using the EToU tariff rates. From the analysis, the D tariff users should remain using the flatt tariff as the electricity usage and price are cheaper. Meanwhile, for E1, E2 and E3, they should change to EToU tariff. But the users need to carefully manage their load profile to utilize the benefits from EToU tariff fully.
