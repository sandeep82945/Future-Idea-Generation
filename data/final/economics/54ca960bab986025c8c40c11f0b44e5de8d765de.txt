Sharing systems have facilitated the redistribution of underused resources by providing convenient online marketplaces for individual sellers and buyers. However, sellers in these systems may not fully disclose the information of their shared commodities, due to strategic behaviors or privacy concerns. Sellers’ strategic information disclosure significantly affects buyers’ user experiences and systems’ reputation. This paper presents the first analytical study on information disclosure and pricing of competing sellers in sharing systems. In particular, we propose a two-stage game framework to capture sellers’ strategic behaviors and buyers’ decisions. Although the optimization problem is challenging due to sellers’ nonconvex and non-monotonic objectives, we completely characterize the complex market equilibria by decomposing it into several tractable subproblems. We demonstrate that full disclosure by all sellers or non-disclosure by all sellers will both lead to intense price competition. The former all-disclosure case is never an equilibrium even when all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs, while the latter non-disclosure case can be an equilibrium under which all sellers get zero profit. We also reveal several critical factors that affect sellers’ information disclosure. Interestingly, sellers’ sharing capacity limitation and buyers’ estimation biases encourage information disclosure as they mitigate sellers’ competition. ii. system model We consider a sharing system where sellers rent out the same type of idle resources2 for monetary reward and buyers pay to access the resources according to their needs. In Sections II and III, we first consider the case where the system consists of two sellers (seller 1 and seller 2) and one buyer. The true quality of seller i’s commodities (service) is denoted by Qi (i ∈ {1, 2}), which is exogenously determined. Without loss of generality, we assume that seller 1 provides higher quality commodities than seller 2, i.e., Q1 ≥ Q2 ≥ 0. The two-seller setting is widely adopted by literature (e.g., [33], [36], [41]). The one-buyer setting is equivalent to the case where multiple heterogeneous buyers come to the system one at a time when sellers have unlimited capacities. We will further study the general case with N sellers and K buyers in both unlimited and limited capacity scenarios in Section IV. A. Strategies of Sellers and Buyers 1) Sellers’ Information Disclosure and Pricing: As a common policy of sharing systems, each seller needs to decide how much private information (e.g., workers’ educational levels, rooms’ decoration styles) of his commodities to disclose (to buyers) and what commodity price to set. We let αi ∈ [0, 1] denote the seller i’s disclosure level, i.e., the fraction of seller i’s disclosed private information. The case of αi = 1 means that seller i discloses all the private
2As a concrete example, a buyer visiting a city at a specific time wants to book an apartment in a specific area in an accommodation sharing system. In this case, the same type of resources mean that the apartments of competing sellers have the same properties in terms of available time and location. Hence, these apartments are substitutes for each other. information and shows the true quality to buyers3. The case of αi ∈ (0, 1) means that seller i voluntarily discloses part of his information. The case of αi = 0 means that seller i discloses minimum information according to the regulation of the system. However, for the convenience of presentation, we describe αi = 0 as no disclosure throughout this paper. When making decisions on information disclosure, each seller has a trade-off between the commodity display effect for attracting buyers and the privacy loss brought by such disclosure. Thus, sellers may adopt incomplete information disclosure strategies, e.g., a worker on TaskRabbit may just sketch his educational experience to protect his privacy and conceal the unfavorable information. As the first attempt to understand such a tradeoff, we assume that buyers can infer the sellers’ information disclosure levels through observations4. Besides choosing the information disclosure level, each seller i also needs to choose a price pi for his commodities. Setting a high price will decrease the competitiveness of the seller, while setting a low price may make the seller unprofitable. 2) Buyers’ Choice: The buyer compares the expected qualities of the commodities provided by the two sellers as well as the corresponding prices, and then chooses the seller that gives her maximum payoff (defined in Section II-B). We assume that the true qualities of sellers satisfy the buyer’s minimum requirement and the buyer only buys one commodity from the chosen seller. B. Buyers’ Payoff When the buyer chooses seller i ∈ {1, 2}, the buyer’s payoff is the difference between her expected commodity quality provided by the seller and her payment to the seller. The expected commodity quality depends on seller i’s information disclosure strategy: • If seller i fully discloses his information, then the buyer
knows that she will experience the true quality Qi5. • If seller i discloses no information, then the buyer perceives
the quality only by her estimation Q0 + ϵ. Here, constant Q0 is buyers’ average prior belief on sellers’ qualities when the sellers do not disclose information. Random variable ϵ indicates the bias of the buyer’s estimation. We assume that ϵ obeys a uniform distribution, i.e., ϵ ∼ U(−ϵ0, ϵ0), where ϵ0 is the maximum deviation from the average prior belief on quality and is assumed to satisfy ϵ0 ≤ Q0/3.6
3We assume that the disclosed information is real and thus reflects the true quality, because sharing systems usually impose severe penalties on sellers who disclose fake information [44], [45]. 4A seller’s disclosure level can be observed consistently by all buyers. For example, suppose that there are five pieces of information about network sharing that sellers can choose to disclose, including the name of the network operator, the total network bandwidth, the total network coverage, the average signal quality, and the average network delay. If a seller only posts the information about coverage and delay on his website, then we can treat the seller’s information disclosure level as α = 0.4. 5We assume that buyers’ different preferences (e.g., on decoration style of houses) do not affect their perception on sellers’ qualities. 6This assumption is not restrictive. First, it is reasonable that buyers in the same sharing system have similar estimation on unknown commodity qualities. Second, literature shows that there is a pull-to-center effect of people’s estimation, i.e., the estimated values of the majority (71% [46], 76.2% [47]) are the middle values. 4 • If seller i partially discloses his information, the buyer’s expected quality is modeled as αiQi+(1−αi)(Q0+ϵ). For the revealed part (fraction αi), the buyer observes quality Qi; while for the unobservable part (fraction 1 − αi), the buyer estimates the quality with (Q0 + ϵ). Hence, when the buyer chooses seller i, the buyer’s payoff
is as follows:
Ui = αiQi + (1− αi)(Q0 + ϵ)− pi, i ∈ {1, 2}. (1)
One can also understand the αi as the weight/probability of the buyer believing in the sellers’ displayed quality. Then, Equation (1) means that more disclosed information (i.e., a larger αi) will increase the buyer’s belief in the commodity quality and reduce buyers’ own estimation. Such a linear expected commodity quality in (1) is also used by recent studies [48], [49], showing that individuals are likely to estimate the unknown details based on their own knowledge/experiences rather than the advertised part. Such a behavior of distrust is natural in sharing systems, since the commodities are from various and strategic individual sellers [50]–[52].7 Note that the buyer has a reservation payoff of zero, i.e., if all sellers offer the buyer negative payoffs, she will exit the market. C. Sellers’ Profits
Each seller’s expected profit is the difference between his expected income charged from the buyer and his privacy cost. Specifically, a seller’s expected income is the product of the price and the probability of winning the buyer. When facing a buyer with an estimation bias of ϵ, seller i’s winning probability is jointly determined by the strategies of all sellers, and is denoted by Pri(α,p, ϵ) ∈ [0, 1], where α = (α1, α2) are sellers’ disclosure levels and p = (p1, p2) are their prices. • If seller i gives the buyer a higher payoff, then Pri(α,p, ϵ) = 1, i.e., seller i wins the buyer. • If seller i offers the buyer a lower payoff, then Pri(α,p, ϵ) = 0, i.e., seller i loses the buyer. • If two sellers give the same payoff, then Pri(α,p, ϵ) = 0.5, i.e., tie breaks randomly. The disclosure of information induces privacy/information costs for sellers [53]. We assume that seller i’s privacy cost is proportional to the private information disclosure level and is modeled as ci · αi, where ci measures how seller i values his privacy. Such a linear privacy cost model has been widely used in literature (e.g., [54], [55]).8
Hence, when facing a buyer with an estimation bias of ϵ, seller i’s profit is summarized as follows9:
Wi(α,p, ϵ) = pi · Pri(α,p, ϵ)− ci · αi, i ∈ {1, 2}. (2) 7The payoff function (1) can be generalized to the more practical case where sellers’ displayed qualities deviate from the true qualities. Assume that seller i’s displayed quality is (Qi+δ) instead of Qi, where δ is the difference between the displayed quality and the true quality. Buyers do not know the value of δ and have to maximize the expected payoff. Their expected payoff is still (1) if δ is a zero-mean variable, i.e., E[δ] = 0. 8Information disclosure happens before the buyer purchasing the commodity, so sellers’ information costs occur even if their commodities are not eventually sold. 9Our model can be applied to the case where sellers’ profits include an additional homogeneous service cost. Such a service cost will not affect the equilibrium results in this paper. Thus, we normalize it to zero. Stage I: Sellers (as leaders) decide (a) their information disclosure levels 𝜶𝜶 and
(b) their prices 𝒑𝒑 to maximize their own expected profits
Stage II: Buyers (as followers) decide which seller to choose to maximize their own payoffs
Fig. 1. The two-stage game. The buyer’s estimation bias ϵ is a random variable that is unknown to sellers, so seller i has to maximize his expected profit:
E[Wi(α,p)] = Eϵ[pi ·Pri(α,p, ϵ)− ci ·αi], i ∈ {1, 2}. (3)
Sellers are involved in game theoretical interactions, as every seller’s profit depends on all sellers’ decisions. D. The Two-Stage Game We model the strategic interactions between sellers and buyers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, as the leaders, sellers simultaneously determine their information disclosure levels α and announce the prices p to the buyers. In Stage II, as the follower, each buyer chooses one seller. Such a model is applicable to both Sections III and IV. This two-stage game captures users’ practical sequential interaction processes in sharing systems (Fig. 1). Specifically, sellers first show buyers their commodity information through photos and descriptions, which reflect their commodity qualities. They also announce the prices for their commodities. Hence, we model the sellers as the leaders in Stage I. After observing sellers’ information and prices, each buyer will pay for a commodity from the seller who gives her the highest payoff. Thus, buyers’ decisions are modeled in Stage II. Mathematically, Stage I is a non-cooperative game among sellers, as each seller’s profit depends on both his strategies and also other sellers’ strategies. In Stage II, as we consider buyers coming to the system one by one, so each buyer makes her own decision independent of other buyers. We analyze the games between sellers as complete information games, i.e., the privacy costs and commodity qualities are known by all sellers (but not by the buyers)10. We use standard backward induction to analyze the dynamic game. Note that the analysis of Stage I is mathematically equivalent to sequentially optimizing the two variables in the backward induction. Specifically, sellers first simultaneously determine their information disclosure levels α (a game of information disclosure) in Stage I-a, and then simultaneously announce the prices p to the buyers in Stage I-b (a game of pricing). For the ease of reading, we list the key notations in Table II. In the following, we will first consider a basic setting where there are two sellers and one buyer. After that, we will further study the general case with many sellers and buyers. 10Consider the example for accommodation sharing on Airbnb. Suppose that a buyer wants to compare sellers in a certain area. In reality, sellers usually have some knowledge about their neighbors’ house (e.g., neighbors’ house qualities, attitude/cost for information privacy) [56], [57]. The main reason is that sellers often have repeated interactions in the market, and as a result it is possible for them to learn each other’s information over time, especially when the commodities are relative stable over time (such as the same houses). However, as the buyers are often one-time visitors to these areas, they do not know the seller’s private information. 5 iii. basic setting: two sellers and one buyer In this section, we consider the basic setting with two sellers and one buyer in the system. We will use the backward induction to analyze the two-stage game, deriving the buyer’s decision, sellers’ prices, and sellers’ information disclosure levels at equilibrium, respectively. After that, we study the factors that influence sellers’ information disclosure. A. Buyer’s Decision in Stage II In this subsection, we analyze the buyer’s decision by comparing the payoffs of choosing different sellers. Specifically, the buyer will choose the seller i∗ who offers her a higher expected payoff in Stage II. Recall that the buyer’s payoff is defined in (1). Therefore, the buyer’s optimal choice i∗ is:
i∗(α,p) = argmax i∈{1,2} αiQi + (1− αi)(Q0 + ϵ)− pi. (4)
If the two sellers give the buyer the same payoff, the buyer will select each seller with an equal probability of 0.5. For the convenience of presentation, we first introduce the following definition:
ψ(αi, αj) ≜ αi(Qi−Q0)−αj(Qj−Q0), i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i ̸= j. (5) The term ψ(αi, αj) is the difference of the buyer’s expected qualities between choosing seller i and seller j under no estimation bias (ϵ = 0). When ψ(αi, αj) > 0, seller i gives the buyer a higher expected quality than seller j. Then, the probability of a seller being selected by the buyer is characterized by the following Lemma 1. Lemma 1. Given a uniformly random estimation bias ϵ ∼ U(−ϵ0, ϵ0)11, the probability of seller i being selected by the buyer is (i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i ̸= j):
Pri(α,p, ϵ) =  0, if (αi − αj)ϵ > ψ(αi, αj)− (pi − pj);12 , if (αi − αj)ϵ = ψ(αi, αj)− (pi − pj); 1, if (αi − αj)ϵ < ψ(αi, αj)− (pi − pj). (6)
Proof of Lemma 1 is given in Appendix I. Lemma 1 shows that the buyer’s decision heavily depends on the difference between two sellers’ information disclosure levels (αi − αj) as well as the buyer’s estimation bias ϵ. • When seller i discloses less information than seller j
(αi < αj), a larger ϵ helps increase seller i’s winning probability. Estimation bias weakens the effectiveness of disclosed information. 11The analysis is similar if we consider a different distribution of the buyer’s quality estimation bias ϵ. The only difference is that when sellers calculated their expected profit, they need to take the expectation over a different distribution of ϵ. The key insights will remain the same. • When two sellers disclose the same amount of information (αi = αj), the value of ϵ does not affect the buyer’s decision. The buyer’s decision is only affected by sellers’ true qualities and prices, as she has the same uncertainty regarding the two seller’s true qualities. Moreover, the value of ψ(αi, αj)−(pi−pj) is the difference between two sellers’ expected quality gap and price gap. Seller i’s winning probability increases with the expected quality gap and decreases with the price gap. Thus, whether a seller can win the buyer largely depends on two sellers’ disclosure strategies in Stage I-a and pricing strategies in Stage I-b . B. Sellers’ Pricing Competition in Stage I-b In this subsection, we analyze sellers’ pricing strategies in Stage I-b. Given the information disclosure levels α = (α1, α2) in Stage I-a, sellers need to decide their prices (p∗1, p ∗ 2) under the uncertainty of ϵ, considering the buyer’s decision in Stage II. Recall that a seller’s expected profit is defined in (3). Since the disclosure level αi is fixed in Stage I-b , seller i only needs to choose a non-negative price to maximize his expected profit. Formally, the Sellers’ Pricing Game and the corresponding equilibrium are defined as follows. Definition 1 (Stage I-b : Sellers’ Pricing Game). • Players: seller 1 and seller 2. • Strategy space: each seller i ∈ {1, 2} chooses his price pi ∈ [0,∞). • Payoff function: each seller i ∈ {1, 2} maximizes his expected profit E[Wi(pi; pj ,α)], where j ∈ {1, 2}, j ̸= i. Definition 2 (Pricing Equilibrium in Stage I-b ). The equilibrium of the Sellers’ Pricing Game is a profile (p∗1, p ∗ 2) such that for each seller i ∈ {1, 2}, E[Wi(p ∗ i , p ∗ j ;α)] ≥ E[Wi(pi, p∗j ;α)], ∀pi ∈ [0,∞). In other words, no seller wants to unilaterally change his pricing decision at an equilibrium. Next, we give the pricing strategies of two sellers at the equilibrium (p∗1, p ∗ 2), which are the functions of the information disclosure levels (α1, α2). Lemma 2. Given the information disclosure levels α = (α1, α2), the equilibrium of the Sellers’ Pricing Game (Stage I-b ) is: i) If α1 ̸= α2,
(p∗1(α), p ∗ 2(α)) = (0,−ψ(α1, α2)− ξ), if ψ(α1, α2) ≤ −3ξ, ( 3ξ+ψ(α1,α2)3 , 3ξ−ψ(α1,α2) 3 ), if −3ξ < ψ(α1, α2) < 3ξ,
(ψ(α1, α2)− ξ, 0), if ψ(α1, α2) ≥ 3ξ,
where ξ ≜ ϵ0|α1 − α2|. ii) If α1 = α2 > 0, there is no pure strategy equilibrium. iii) If α1 = α2 = 0, p∗1 = p ∗ 2 = 0. Proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix II. Here we list some interesting observations. • Fig. 2 shows sellers’ optimal prices when they set different
disclosure levels (α1 ̸= α2). If the expected quality gap is large (|ψ(α1, α2)| ≥ 3ξ), the seller who offers a higher
6
expected quality will set a positive price, and his competitor (the other seller) will set a zero price. If the expected quality gap is small (|ψ(α1, α2)| < 3ξ), they will both set positive prices. We shall see in next subsection that the seller who sets a positive price has a positive expected profit; the seller who sets a zero price never discloses information and gets a zero profit. • Both sellers disclosing same amount of information (α1 = α2 = α > 0) is never an equilibrium. If their disclosure levels are the same in Stage I-a, the difference of buyer’s payoffs between choosing two sellers is U1−U2 = α(Q1− Q2)− (p1 − p2). Since (without loss of generality we have assumed) Q1 ≥ Q2, the ensuing price competition in Stage I-b will lead seller 2 to a zero price and a negative profit −c2α2, which is worse than no disclosure. • If no seller discloses information (α1 = α2 = 0), then U1− U2 = p2 − p1. There will be an intense price competition where both sellers set a zero price at the equilibrium. Note that sellers’ pricing decisions depend on information disclosure levels, which will be analyzed in next subsection. C. Sellers’ Information Disclosure in Stage I-a In this subsection, we study the sellers’ information disclosure strategies in Stage I-a. Considering the pricing strategies in Stage I-b and the buyer’s decision in Stage II, the sellers need to decide the information disclosure levels (α1, α2) in Stage I-a to maximize their expected profits. Formally, the Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game and the corresponding equilibrium are defined as follows. Definition 3 (Stage I: Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game). • Players: seller 1 and seller 2. • Strategy space: each seller i ∈ {1, 2} chooses his informa-
tion disclosure level αi ∈ [0, 1]. • Payoff function: each seller i ∈ {1, 2} maximizes his
expected profit E[Wi(αi;αj)], where j ∈ {1, 2}, j ̸= i. Definition 4 (Disclosure Equilibrium in Stage I). The equilibrium of the Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game is a profile (α∗1, α ∗ 2) such that for each seller i ∈ {1, 2},
E[Wi(α ∗ i , α ∗ j )] ≥ E[Wi(αi, α∗j )], ∀αi ∈ [0, 1]. To obtain sellers’ expected profit function E[Wi(αi;αj)] in Stage I-a, we substitute the results of Stage II (Lemma 1) and Stage I-b (Lemma 2) into (3), as well as calculating the expectation over random bias ϵ. It turns out to be a challenging optimization problem in Stage I-a due to sellers’ complex non-convex objective functions (as shown in Equations (14) and (15) in Appendix III). The challenge is induced by i) the discontinuity of piecewise objective functions, ii) the coupling among decision variables (α1, α2) in a complex non-linear
way, iii) uncertain monotonicity and convexity due to the uncertain numerical values of parameters Q1, Q2, c1, c2, Q0, and ϵ0. We solve the complex Stage I-a through properly decomposing it into several subproblems, so that the objective functions can de divided into analyzable convex or monotonic pieces. There are different market equilibria under different conditions of sellers’ marginal costs (c1, c2) and qualities (Q1, Q2). To capture these different cases, we first introduce sellers’ behavior patterns which heavily depend on sellers’ marginal costs (Section III-C1). Then, we show how sellers’ qualities affect the appearance of these behavior patterns (Section III-C2). 1) Behavior Pattern: Behavior pattern specifies the two sellers’ information disclosure decisions at the equilibrium (α∗1, α ∗ 2). Lemma 3. There exist four kinds of behavior patterns at the equilibrium:
• Pattern I: there is a unique equilibrium (α∗1, α ∗ 2) = (1, 0). • Pattern II: there are two co-existing equilibria (α∗1, α ∗ 2) =
(1, 0) and (α∗1, α ∗ 2) = (0, 1). • Pattern III: there is a unique equilibrium (α∗1, α ∗ 2) = (0, 1). • Pattern IV: there is a unique equilibrium (α∗1, α ∗ 2) = (0, 0). Proof of Lemma 3 is given in Appendix III. These behavior patterns largely depend on sellers’ marginal costs (c1, c2). In Pattern I, seller 1 fully discloses information while seller 2 does not disclose information, which usually happens when seller 1 (the higher-quality seller) has a small marginal cost (as we shall see in Fig. 3 in Section III-C2). In Pattern II, one of the sellers disclosing information is an equilibrium, which happens when seller 1 has a moderate marginal cost and seller 2 has a small marginal cost. In Pattern III, seller 2 fully discloses information while seller 1 chooses no disclosure, which happens when seller 1 has a large marginal cost but seller 2’s marginal cost is small. In Pattern IV, no seller discloses information, which usually happens when they both have high marginal costs. Although different costs lead to different behavior patterns, some of the patterns do not exist under certain quality conditions (Q1, Q2). For example, as we shall see in Theorem 1, when both sellers have poor qualities, the equilibrium is (α∗1, α ∗ 2) = (0, 0) (Pattern IV) regardless of the costs (c1, c2), and the other three patterns I, II, III are not achievable. 2) Equilibrium Characterization: In the following, we characterize the equilibria by showing how the qualities affect the behavior patterns. Theorem 1. There exist four equilibrium structures, which are decided by sellers’ qualities (Q1, Q2):
• “All-Achievable”: all patterns (I, II, III, IV) are achievable (Fig. 3(a))12. This happens when (Q1, Q2) are in one of the
12The notation tA1, tA2, tB1, tB2, and tC in Fig. 3 are thresholds that distinguish different behavior patterns. The specific values vary with qualities and are summarized in Appendix IV. 7 𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑐𝑐𝐴 𝑐𝑐1𝑂𝑂 𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴1 𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴 I II III IV 𝑐𝑐𝐴 𝑐𝑐1𝑂𝑂 I IV III 𝑡𝑡𝐵𝐵𝐴𝑡𝑡𝐵𝐵1 𝑡𝑡𝐵𝐵𝐴

• “No-Mixed-Pattern”: Patterns I, III and IV are achievable, but Pattern II (which contains two co-existing equilibria) is not achievable (Fig. 3(b)). This happens when (Q1, Q2) are in one of the following two cases:
1) Q1 ∈ [ Q0 + (6− 3 √ 5)ϵ0, Q0 + 3ϵ0 ) ,
Q2∈ [ Q0−3ϵ0, Q0−6ϵ0+ √ 54ϵ20−(Q1−Q0−6ϵ0)2 ) ;
2) Q1∈ [Q0+3ϵ0,+∞),Q2∈ [ Q0−3ϵ0,Q0−6ϵ0+3 √ 5ϵ0 ) . • “L-NeverDisclosure”: only Patterns I and IV are achievable (Fig. 3(c)). Seller 2 who has a lower quality never discloses information, and whether seller 1 discloses information depends on his cost. This happens when 0 ≤ Q2 < Q0 − 3ϵ0 < Q1. • “None-Disclosure”: only Pattern IV is achievable (Fig. 3(d)). None of the sellers discloses information. This happens when 0 ≤ Q2 < Q1 < Q0 − 3ϵ0. The relationship between qualities (Q1, Q2) and the corresponding equilibrium structures is summarized in Fig 4. Proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix III. For the convenience of presenting the insights, we define seller i’s commodity quality to be “good (G)” when Qi > Q0+3ϵ0, or “medium (M )” when Q0 − 3ϵ0 < Qi < Q0 + 3ϵ0, or “poor (P )” when Qi < Q0−3ϵ0. Thus, since Q1 ≥ Q2, there are six possible quality profiles (Q1, Q2) in total: GG, GM , MM , GP , MP , PP , which are also shown in Fig. 4. First, as shown in Fig. 4, when qualities (Q1, Q2) are given, the corresponding equilibrium structure belongs to one of the four cases. Second, as shown in Fig. 3, given the equilibrium structure, the equilibrium (i.e., behavior pattern) is uniquely determined by sellers costs (c1, c2). Sellers tend to not disclose information when the disclosure costs are unaffordable. Third, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show that Pattern II only happens when sellers’ quality difference and costs difference are relatively small. Thus, sellers’ strategies are more symmetric that either seller disclosing information is an equilibrium. We can further derive the following insights about commodity qualities and sellers’ disclosure strategies:
Observation 1. i) A poor-quality seller will never disclose information, even if the disclosure is costless. ii) If a medium-quality seller discloses information at the equilibrium, both sellers will have positive prices and positive expected profits. iii) If a good-quality seller discloses information at the equilibrium, the other seller will choose a zero price and obtain a zero profit. We further elaborate the Observation 1 in the following. (i) Such a non-disclosure situation exists in the profiles of GP , MP , and PP . This is surprising, as we would expect that a seller will disclose information when the privacy cost is zero. The reason that this is not in general true is that when the seller’s quality is poor, disclosing information will decrease the buyer’s payoff, which makes the seller less competitive. (ii) Since medium quality is close to the buyer’s estimated quality, both sellers have positive expected probabilities to win the buyer and can expect positive profits. (iii) Since good quality is much higher than the buyer’s estimated quality, if the seller who discloses information at equilibrium is of good quality, he will definitely win the competition and the other seller can only get a zero profit. The results in this subsection show that information disclosure decision significantly depends on sellers’ commodity qualities and privacy costs. Next, we will further explore other influencing factors of information disclosure. D. What Affects Information Disclosure? According to Sections III-A, III-B, and III-C, we can summarize the equilibria of the two-stage game in Appendix V, including the sellers’ information disclosure strategies in Stage I-a, sellers’ pricing decisions in Stage I-b , and the buyer’s decisions in Stage II. These results reflect the relationship between price competition and information disclosure (Section III-D1). In addition, the relationship between the buyer’s esti-
8 mation bias and information disclosure is revealed in Section III-D2. 1) Price Competition and Information Disclosure: There are certain cases where sellers do not disclose information, which reveal the relationship between price competition and information disclosure. Proposition 1. Both sellers fully disclosing information is never an equilibrium. It is natural to presume that sellers with good commodity qualities and low privacy costs will both choose to disclose information. However, Proposition 1 shows that full disclosure by both sellers will never be an equilibrium. The best response for seller 2 should be no disclosure when seller 1 chooses to disclose information. This is because as Q1 ≥ Q2, both sellers fully disclosing information will lead to severe market competition, under which seller 2 will choose a zero price and hence obtains a negative profit −c2. As this is worse than no disclosure, hence we have the conclusion in Proposition 1. Moreover, a seller does not disclose information when his cost is unaffordable or quality is poor. In this case the model degenerates to a pure price competition, as summarized in Proposition 2. Proposition 2. When none of the sellers choose to disclose information, the game degenerates into a simple pricing competition, in which both sellers set the prices to zero and obtain a zero profit. 2) Estimation Bias and Information Disclosure: To study the impact of the buyer’s estimation bias on sellers’ information disclosure, we further consider a benchmark case where the buyer has no estimation bias (ϵ0 = 0) in Appendix VI. Proposition 3 summarizes the comparison results:
Proposition 3. There are three key differences between the positive estimation bias (ϵ0 > 0) case and no estimation bias (ϵ0 = 0) case:
i) The seller i whose quality is below average (Qi < Q0) never discloses information when ϵ0 = 0; but he may do so when ϵ0 > 0.
ii) The seller who does not disclose information earns a zero profit when ϵ0 = 0; but he may obtain a positive profit when ϵ0 > 0.
iii) It is never possible for both sellers to receive positive expected profits when ϵ0 = 0. However, it is possible when ϵ0 > 0. Proposition 3 shows that the buyer’s estimation bias mitigates market competition and encourages information disclosure. Specifically, (i) the estimation bias motivates the seller whose commodity quality is below average to disclose information; (ii) the estimation bias enables sellers who do not disclose information to achieve positive expected profits; (iii) the estimation bias makes it possible for both sellers to receive positive expected profits. Therefore, when there is an increasing heterogeneity of buyers in the system (and thus diverse estimation biases), e.g., when the system expands buyer’s market, there will be more disclosure and less competition. As a quick summary, we have shown that full disclosure or non-disclosure by both sellers will both cause intense price competition, but the existence of estimation biases can mitigate this effect. Next, we study whether above results still hold when the system consists of multiple users, and analyze how sellers’ capacities affect market competition and information disclosure. iv. general setting: n sellers and k buyers In this section, we consider the more general case of a set N = {1, 2, ..., N} sellers and K = {1, 2, ...,K} buyers. To reveal the impact of sellers’ capacities on information disclosure, we further analyze the equilibria where sellers have unlimited or limited capacities, respectively. We still adopt the two-stage game model. Sellers make their information disclosure decisions and prices in Stage I. In Stage II, buyers come to the system one by one, and each buyer purchases one commodity from a seller with a spare capacity. We make several assumptions. First, different buyers have different estimation biases, which are i.i.d., i.e., following the same distribution ϵk ∼ U(−ϵ0, ϵ0),∀k ∈ K. Second, since solving the non-convex optimization problem in the basic setting is already challenging, it’s quite difficult to perform pairwise comparison for N sellers and then derive all sellers’ pricing strategies as well as information disclosure levels. We can observe that although sellers’ strategy space of information disclosure level is [0, 1] in the basic setting, the result at the equilibrium turns out to be either 1 or 0 (Lemma 3). Thus, to simplify the analysis, we assume that sellers’ information disclosure strategy space is {0, 1} in this section. In this case, the N Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game and the corresponding equilibrium are13:
Definition 5 (Stage I-a: N Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game). • Players: sellers in N . • Strategy space: each seller i ∈ N chooses his information
disclosure level αi ∈ {0, 1}. • Payoff function: seller i maximizes his expected profit E[Wi(αi;α−i)], where α−i ≜ (αk,∀k ∈ N , k ̸= i). Definition 6. The equilibrium of the N Sellers’ Information Disclosure Game is a profile α∗ = (α∗1, ..., α ∗ N ) ⊆ {0, 1}N such that for each seller i ∈ N ,
E[Wi(α ∗ i ,α ∗ −i)] ≥ E[Wi(αi,α∗−i)],∀αi ∈ {0, 1}. In the following, we will consider three possible scenarios of sellers’ capacities (i.e., the number of buyers that sellers can serve). i) Each seller has an unlimited capacity. This is a reasonable approximation of the practical case where each seller has an enough capacity to serve all the coming buyers. For example, some sellers in an accommodation system own many properties or chain hotels. 13As we mainly focus on studying sellers’ information disclosure, the analysis of buyers’ optimal strategies and sellers’ optimal prices in this section are given in Appendices VII-X. 9 ii) Each seller has a single capacity (one buyer per seller). This is motivated by the practical case where a worker in labor sharing systems can only serve one buyer at a time. iii) Each seller has a limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller). This corresponds to the case where a seller can sell his leftover network resource to multiple buyers at the same time. The first and second scenarios can be regarded as special cases of this more general scenario. A. Unlimited Capacity In this subsection, we analyze sellers’ information disclosure strategies under the scenario where each seller has an unlimited capacity. The analysis also serves as the benchmark for the limited capacity scenarios. We denote by ΦeU the set of sellers who disclose information simultaneously at the equilibrium eU , where eU can be any possible equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario. Denote by |ΦeU | the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eU . Given the commodity qualities and privacy costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 2 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:
Theorem 2. In the unlimited capacity scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria:
i) One-seller disclosure (i.e., |ΦeU | = 1) is the equilibrium if and only if at least one seller i ∈ N has (Qi, ci) in one of the two cases in (7). 1) Qi ∈ (Q0 + ϵ0, Q0 + 3ϵ0) , ci ∈ [ 0, (Qi −Q0 + ϵ0)2
8ϵ0
] ;
2) Qi ∈ [Q0 + 3ϵ0,∞) , ci ∈ [0, Qi −Q0 − ϵ0] . (7)
The only seller i who discloses information at the equilibrium (i.e., α∗i = 1,α ∗ −i = 0) has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (8), Qi ≥ Qj − cj ,∀j ∈ N , j ̸= i. (8)
The equilibrium is not unique when more than one seller has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (8). Any such seller disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium. ii) No disclosure is the equilibrium (i.e., |ΦeU | = 0) if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i ∈ N . Proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix VIII. Theorem 2 shows that at most one seller discloses information at an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario (i.e., |ΦeU | ≤ 1), which is a bit counter-intuitive. If more than one seller discloses information, all buyers will choose the seller who gives the highest payoff since the seller has an unlimited capacity. Thus, those unselected sellers who have disclosed information will obtain negative profits. It is impossible for two sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium to provide the same highest payoff for buyers, even if they have the same quality. A slight price reduction of one of the two sellers will attract all buyers, so they will keep decreasing their prices in the competition until one seller’s profit is no larger than no disclosure. Hence, multiple sellers disclosing information cannot be an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity

More importantly, Theorem 2 specifies which seller discloses information at an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario. The condition (7) means that seller i is willing to disclose information when others do not. From the illustration of (7) in Fig. 5, we can observe that the sellers who are willing to disclose information have high qualities and low costs. The condition (8) ensures that seller j will not disclose information when seller i does, which requires the seller i who fully discloses his information at an equilibrium to have a quality substantially better than all other sellers. Next, we study the impact of capacities on sellers’ information disclosure by considering the limited capacity scenario. B. Single Capacity (One Buyer Per Seller) In this subsection, we focus on the sellers’ information disclosure strategies when each seller has a limited capacity and can only serve one buyer. Since we are studying sellers’ strategies under competition, we assume that supply is larger than demand14. We denote by ΦeSO the set of sellers who disclose information simultaneously at the equilibrium eSO, where eSO can be any possible equilibrium in the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario15. Denote by |ΦeSO| the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eSO. Given the qualities and costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 3 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:
Theorem 3. In the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria:
i) At the equilibrium, 1 ≤ |ΦeSO| ≤ K if and only if at least one seller i ∈ N has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7). Each seller i ∈ ΦeSO who discloses information at the equilibrium has (Qi, ci) satisfying both (7) and (9),
Qi ≥ Qj − cj ,∀i ∈ ΦeSO,∀j ∈ N\ΦeSO. (9)
The equilibrium is not unique when more than K sellers have (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (9). Any K of them disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium. ii) At the equilibrium, |ΦeSO| = 0 if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i ∈ N . 14The analysis of the scenario where supply is no larger than demand (i.e., no game among sellers) is given in Appendix XII. 15Subscript SO represents single capacity (one buyer per seller), similarly in the following, subscript U represents unlimited capacity and subscript LM represents limited capacity (multiple buyer per seller). 10
Proof of Theorem 3 is given in Appendix IX. Theorem 3 shows that at most K sellers fully disclose information at an equilibrium in this scenario, where K is the number of buyers. Each seller can serve one of the K buyers. If there are more than K sellers with full disclosure, the unselected sellers will get negative profits, which is worse than no disclosure. Hence, this will not happen at the equilibrium. Moreover, Theorem 3 identifies which sellers disclose information at an equilibrium in the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario. The results show that, in case (i), there is competition among the sellers, and those who eventually disclose information at an equilibrium need to have qualities significantly better than those sellers who choose not to disclose information (i.e., (9)). In case (ii), for any seller, disclosure leads to a lower profit than non-disclosure, so no seller will disclose information. Finally, we will consider the most general case where each seller can serve multiple buyers. C. Limited Capacity (Multiple Buyers Per Seller) In this subsection, we analyze the sellers’ information disclosure strategies under the scenario where sellers have limited capacities and each seller can serve multiple buyers. Let ωi ∈ (1,+∞) denote the capacity of seller i. If ωi = ∞,∀i ∈ N , it corresponds to the unlimited capacity scenario; If ωi = 1,∀i ∈ N , it corresponds to the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario. Since we are studying sellers’ behaviors in competition, we still assume that supply is larger than demand in this subsection. We denote by ΦeLM the set of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eLM , where eLM can be any possible equilibrium in the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario. Denote by |ΦeLM | the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eLM . Given the qualities and costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 4 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:
Theorem 4. In the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria: i) At the equilibrium, 1 ≤ |ΦeLM | < K if and only if at least
one seller i ∈ N has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7). Each seller i ∈ ΦeLM who discloses information at equilibrium has (Qi, ci) satisfying both (7) and (10). Qi ≥ Qj − cj ,∀i ∈ ΦeLM ,∀j ∈ N\ΦeLM (10)
The equilibrium is not unique when the total capacity of a proper subset of sellers with (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (10) is larger than or equal to K. Any subset of these sellers with capacity satisfying (11) disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium.∑
i∈ΦeLM ωi ≥ K, (11a)∑ i∈ΦeLM ωi − ωj < K, j = arg min i∈ΦeLM {Qi − pi}. (11b)
ii) At the equilibrium, |ΦeLM | = 0 if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i ∈ N . Proof of Theorem 4 is given in Appendix X. Theorem 4 characterizes the equilibria in the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario and identifies which sellers disclose information at an equilibrium. In case (i), if the total capacity of sellers who are eligible to disclose information (i.e., satisfying (7) and (10)) is larger than the number of buyers K, the sellers who eventually disclose information at an equilibrium (i.e., sellers in ΦeLM ) will have exactly enough capacity for buyers. To be more specific, equation (11a) means that total capacity of the sellers in ΦeLM is no smaller than K. Equation (11b) means that at the equilibrium, without the seller who offers buyers the smallest payoff among the sellers in ΦeLM , the remaining sellers in Φ e LM cannot serve all K buyers. One may presume that some sellers in ΦeLM may have some unsold capacity such that (11b) may not hold. However, it is impossible that there exist two sellers who disclose information and both have idle capacities, even if they have the same quality. Buyers choose sellers who offer higher payoffs to them, so two sellers having idle capacities means that they provide the same lowest payoff among disclosure sellers (i.e., mini∈ΦeLM {Qi − pi}) to buyers. A slight price reduction of one of the two sellers will attract the buyers who have chosen the other seller, so they will keep decreasing their prices in the competition until a seller’s profit is no larger than no disclosure. In case (ii), no seller is willing to disclose information as all sellers have low qualities or high costs (i.e., not satisfy (7)). Next, we will compare the number of sellers who disclose information at equilibria in three capacity scenarios. D. Comparison of Information Disclosure in Three Scenarios In this subsection, we compare the results derived in the three capacity scenarios to explore the impact of capacity limitation on information disclosure. Recall that eU , eSO and eLM denote the equilibria under the three capacity scenarios, respectively. Moreover, |ΦeU |, |ΦeSO|, and |ΦeLM | are the corresponding numbers of sellers who disclose information at the equilibria. Based on Theorem 2, Propositions 3 and 4, we have the following relationship between capacity limitation and information disclosure:
Corollary 1. For the same set of sellers and buyers, given any eU , eSO and eLM , the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium satisfies |ΦeU | ≤ |ΦeLM | ≤ |ΦeSO|. Proof of Corollary 1 is given in Appendix XI. Corollary 1 shows that more limited capacity allows more sellers to disclose information, encouraging the information disclosure in the system. Moreover, non-disclosure sellers will obtain a zero profit due to the fierce competition, so capacity limitation also enables more sellers to get positive profits, mitigating the market competition. v. numerical analysis In this section, we conduct numerical experiments to validate our analytical results and insights. So far, we have derived the closed-form solutions to the equilibria under three capacity scenarios (Theorems 2, 3, and 4), and we have rigorously proved the relationship between sellers’ capacities and information disclosure (Corollary 1). 11

(c) Unlimited Capacity Scenario (ω = ∞) Fig. 6. Eligible region: sellers with (Q, c) in the blue region can disclose information at the equilibria. Next, we will give a concrete illustration through simulation. Since we study the competition among sellers, we set the number of sellers N = 200, which is larger than the number of buyers K = 32. As we assume that sellers’ commodity qualities Q takes the values in [1, 20], we set buyers’ average prior believe Q0 to be 10, which is the average commodity quality in the market. The estimation bias is ϵ0 = 2. The marginal privacy cost c in [1, 10] can capture different cases where sellers with high, medium, or low privacy concerns. As shown in Fig. 6, we simulate three capacity scenarios, respectively. More specifically, ω = 1 is the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario, ω = 8 is the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario, and ω = ∞ is the unlimited capacity scenario. The x-axis is the commodity quality and y-axis is the marginal privacy cost. The notations of “P ”(poor),“M”(medium) and “G”(good) refer to the partition of sellers’ qualities, which have been defined in Section III-C2. In each of the subfigures, the blue shaded area corresponds to the eligible region, within which each seller can be the seller who discloses information at equilibria. For example, any seller in the eligible region of Fig. 6(c) disclosing information and other sellers not is an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario. Fig. 6 shows that the sellers who can disclose information (i.e., in the eligible region) have high qualities and low marginal costs (as proved in Theorems 2, 3, and 4). Furthermore, larger capacities (i.e., larger ω) require the sellers with full disclosure at an equilibrium to have higher (more competitive) qualities, corresponding to Q ≥ 12 in single capacity scenario, Q ≥ 17 in limited capacity scenario, and Q ≥ 19 in unlimited capacity scenario in Fig. 6. Therefore, as the sellers’ capacities increase, a smaller number of sellers can disclose information at an equilibrium. This is consistent with our finding that larger capacity strengthens the competition among sellers and thus discourages the information disclosure. Moreover, this paper provides a clear understanding of the observations in previous numerical studies in literature and some system regulations in practice. For example, Xu et al. [32] numerically showed that extra information may exhibit a diminishing effect on buyer purchase behavior. This has been validated and explained by our paper that disclosing information is worse than no disclosure in some cases (Theorem 1). Airbnb has launched the Airbnb Select program to improve property qualities and has restricted hosts from renting out multiple properties in some areas [19], [20]. Both regulations eventually encourage sellers’ information disclosure according
to our analysis (Theorem 1 and Corollary 1). Overall, the results in this paper provide guidelines for sellers to optimize information disclosure behaviors in sharing systems. The results can also facilitate sharing systems’ regulation decisions and incentive mechanism design. vi. conclusion This paper studied sellers’ information disclosure strategies in competition in sharing systems. We captured the trade-off between sellers’ commodity display effects and privacy costs, and proposed a two-stage game to characterize the interactions between sellers and buyers. We completely presented the complex structure of equilibria under different conditions despite the non-convexity of the optimization problem. The results showed that full disclosure by all sellers will never be an equilibrium even if they all have good qualities and low costs; none of the sellers disclosing information will make all sellers get zero profit.
