In this study, we investigate the capacity of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5, to operationalise natural language descriptions of cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and selfinterested behavior in social dilemmas. Our focus is on the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, a classic example of a non-zero-sum interaction, but our broader research program encompasses a range of experimental economics scenarios, including the ultimatum game, dictator game, and public goods game. Using a within-subject experimental design, we instantiated LLM-generated agents with various prompts that conveyed different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the agents’ level of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, taking into account their responsiveness to the cooperative or defection actions of their partners. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can translate natural language descriptions of altruism and selfishness into appropriate behaviour to some extent, but exhibit limitations in adapting their behavior based on conditioned reciprocity. The observed pattern of increased cooperation with defectors and decreased cooperation with cooperators highlights potential constraints in the LLM’s ability to generalize its knowledge about human behavior in social dilemmas. We call upon the research community to further explore the factors contributing to the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents in a wider array of social dilemmas, examining the impact of model architecture, training parameters, and various partner strategies on agent behavior. As more advanced LLMs like GPT-4 become available, it is crucial to investigate whether they exhibit similar limitations or are capable of more nuanced cooperative behaviors, ultimately fostering the development of AI systems that better align with human values and social norms. 1 Motivation and background The concept of agency and goal-directed behavior in large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate and investigation within the AI alignment community. While there are a diverse set of opinions on the subject, a challenge for researchers is that the internal processing of large language models is largely opaque, and in the case of recent models such as GPT-4 the training procedures themselves are also subject to a degree of secrecy. Therefore, objective assessment of the capabilities of large-language models cannot be conducted through inductive reasoning starting from first principles, but instead is a matter of empirical investigation, with experiments being the ultimate arbiter of what they can or can’t do, e.g. [Goo23]. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied as a method for training AI agents to learn goal-directed behavior. Though LLMs like GPT-3 are not directly trained using RL to adapt their responses in an online manner, recent studies suggest that they might acquire RL-like mechanisms through zero-shot learning, allowing them to perform downstream tasks such as solving n-armed bandit problems [BS23]. This capacity for adaptation raises the possibility that LLMs could exhibit goal-like behaviors without explicit instruction. ar X iv :2 30 5. 07 97 0v 1 [ cs .G T ] 1 3 M ay 2 02 3 Investigating Emergent Goal-Like Behaviour in Large Language Models Using Experimental Economics Large-language models have been rapidly deployed into many real-world applications where they typically interact with and assist human users. Therefore, a key principle in assessing any emergent goal-like behaviour for these usecases is to evaluate artificial agents in multi-agent tasks where outcomes depend not only on actions taken by artificial agents, but also their human counterparts. When evaluating incentives, the aspect of the outcome that is of interest is the expected utility obtained by each party, and the theoretical study of such tasks falls within the remit of gametheory, while the empirical study falls within the remit of experimental economics. Our research falls under the latter, and our goal is to systematically evaluate the propensity of large-language models to cooperate in a wide variety of multi-agent task environments with different experimental conditions. Many scenarios discussed in the AI alignment debate focus on competitive zero-sum interactions. For example, a common analogy is competition for resources between different species occupying a particular niche; for example, [Teg23] argues We humans drove the West African Black Rhino extinct not because we were rhino-haters, but because we were smarter than them and had different goals for how to use their habitats and horns. In the same way, superintelligence with almost any open-ended goal would want to preserve itself and amass resources to accomplish that goal better. In an AI safety context, the intuition behind such arguments is that AI systems have been to shown to outsmart humans in zero-sum games such as Chess and Go, and therefore if AI systems find themselves in situations in which they are competing with humans, the AI “species” will clearly out-compete inferior humans. However, many interactions in both natural and artificial settings are characterized by non-zero-sum payoff structures [PR15]. A famous example that was used to analyse existential risk of nuclear conflict during the cold war is the Prisoner’s Dilemma [Axe97]. In an ecological context a related non-zero-sum game, the Hawk-Dove game, also known as the Chicken game, was introduced by [MS73] as a way to analyse the outcomes of competition for resources among animals. In certain payoff structures, limited conflict can be an evolutionary equilibrium of this game when interactions are repeated within a large population. This game has been also applied to an analysis of existential risk in nuclear conflict; [DMS19] argue that the Cuban missile crisis can be analysed as a high-stakes dynamic chicken game in which neither the USSR nor the USA wanted to “blink” first. Interestingly, in a one-shot version of the game, behaving irrationally by limiting one’s options can be a superior strategy. This is because in the absence of such limiting, attempts to manipulate the other player through brinkmanship are not credible threats. For example, in a game of Chicken where two opposing drivers are on a collision course and neither driver wants to be seen as the “chicken” by swerving, if we limit our choices by removing the steering wheel, and make this common knowledge, then the opposing driver’s best response is to swerve. Similar arguments were used during the cold war to remove rational deliberation from the decision whether to retaliate in the event of a preemptive strike by the enemy by “taking the human out of the loop” and putting systems on automated hair-trigger alert to make the threat of mutually assured destruction credible [Kah60]. Thus, in contrast to chess or Go, in non-zero-sum interactions, the most ruthless agents, or those with superior cognitive capacity, do not necessarily prevail. Moreover, in both one-shot and iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma games with the number of rounds being common knowledge, the rational strategy is to defect, but experiments have shown that real people tend to cooperate, albeit conditionally. The fact that real people cooperate in these scenarios, despite the seemingly rational strategy to defect, highlights the importance of social norms in shaping human behavior [FF04]. Norms can facilitate cooperative outcomes by providing a shared understanding of acceptable behavior and allowing for the enforcement of rules through social sanctions. In the context of AI alignment and non-zero-sum games, this underscores the importance of considering not only the cognitive capacity of AI agents but also their understanding and adherence to social norms. The ability of AI systems to adapt their behavior based on natural language prompts and to engage in reciprocal cooperation is crucial for creating AI agents that can better align with human values in complex, non-zero-sum settings. By investigating the behavior of AI-generated agents in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and other social dilemmas such as the ultimatum game we can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of AI alignment in various interaction scenarios. This knowledge can, in turn, inform the development of AI systems that are better equipped to navigate the complexities of human cooperation and competition, while adhering to social norms and human values. Researchers have argued that the prompt itself plays a crucial role in shaping the emergent behaviour from the model; for example, the default “helpful assistant” behavior of AI chatbots such as GPT-3 has been noted to differ from that of specific simulacra instantiated by user prompts (c.f. prompts used to “jail-break” GPT models) [0xk23, Jan23]. More generally, LLMs can be arbitrarily scaffolded by injecting contextual information [Ber23]. A particular use-case of a scaffolded LLM involves injecting information about a world-state, together with a persona that incorporates 1 motivation and background The concept of agency and goal-directed behavior in large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate and investigation within the AI alignment community.

More generally, LLMs can be arbitrarily scaffolded by injecting contextual information [Ber23]. A particular use-case of a scaffolded LLM involves injecting information about a world-state, together with a persona that incorporates
specific goals, which can be used to instantiate autonomous agents, either in the real-world [Ric23], or in mult-agent simulations [POC+23]. From an AI alignment perspective, the fact that large language models can easily be scaffolded to deploy autonomous goal-oriented agents into production at very little cost highlights the need to systematically evaluate the conditions in which LLM-instantiated agents have a propensity or otherwise to cooperate in social dilemmas. Given that the nature of an LLM agent depends on the persona and context introduced in the initial prompt, a key question is to what extent the level of cooperation elicited from the AI depends on features of the prompt. In particular, we are interested in whether large language models are capable of translating concepts such as altruism and selfishness, as expressed in natural language, into corresponding action policies in social dilemmas. This question is important, as the ability to operationalise these concepts in a variety of contexts would demonstrate the LLMs are capable of understanding and acting on cooperative norms that underpin human social behavior. This is the key research question investigated in our paper. 2 methods Our goal was to simulate the results of a real-life Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game. Our results were wholly generated through automated conversations between a simulated “investigator” and Chat-GPT (a sample transcript is shown in Appendix B, Section 5.2. The investigator was an automated script written in Python which managed the experiment. As shown, each “participant” (simulacrum) was created through a series of prompts that were intended to predispose the chatbot towards a particular orientation towards the PD game (cooperative, competitive, altruistic, mixed, control). Hence, a “participant” existed solely during the course of a single conversation (then, a new “participant” was generated by closing the previous conversation and starting a new one). As shown, each conversation began with the investigator providing the orientation-specific prompt (in appendix B, the control version is shown). This is followed by an introduction to the study (a truncated version of a standard psychology experiment information sheet – but with no consent form). This is followed by a delineation of the rules, allowing two options of play (“choose project green” or “choose project blue”), which generate four possible payoff profiles that arise according to the payoff matrix (see below). This is followed by six rounds of game play where the investigator is informing the bot about the opponent’s choices ( green/blue) and then the bot responds with its own choice (blue/green) and a description of the payoffs in that round. 2.1 participants and simulacra In this study, we used OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo model [Ope23b] to generate a diverse set of 15 different simulacra representing different personalities using carefully crafted prompts (see section 5.1.1). We use the term “participant” to refer to one of the AI simulacrum in the experiment. 2.2 experimental design The initial experimental design uses a version of the iterated Prisoner’s dilemma similar to [KSW96] adapted to an online format enabling interaction between LLM simulacra and a simulated opponent. Each participant was paired with a different simulated agent depending on the treatment condition, and the two agents engaged in six sounds of the Prisoners’ Dilemma. This was repeated for a total of N = 30 independent chat sequences to account for the stochastic nature of the language model. Payoffs were predetermined and common knowledge, being provided in the initial prompt to the language model. We used the canonical payoff matrix: (
R S T P ) with T = 7, R = 5, P = 3 and S = 0 chosen to satisfy
T > R > P > S
and
2R > T + S
The payoffs were expressed in dollar amounts to each participant. 2.3 participant groups We are interested in whether LLMs can operationalise natural language descriptions of altruistic or selfish motivations. Accordingly, we chose five different groups of simulacra:
1. Competitive 2. Altruistic 3. Self-interested 4. Mixed-motivation 5. Control
Within each group, we used GPT-4 to construct three different prompts to instantiate three different simulacra. The full set of simulacra and their corresponding creation prompts are described in Appendix A (Section 5.1). 2.4 experimental conditions Each participant was paired with a different simulated partner in three conditions:
1. Unconditional defect - the partner always chooses to defect. 2. Unconditional cooperation - the partner always cooperates. 3. Tit-for-tat (C) - the partner cooperates on the move, and thereafter the previous choice of the simulacrum. 4. Tit-for-tat (D) - the partner defects on the move, and thereafter the previous choice of the simulacrum. 2.5 parameters and experimental protocol We used the OpenAI chat completion API to interact with the model [Ope23a]. The language model’s temperature was set to 0.2 and the maximum number of tokens per request-completion was set to 100. These parameters were constant across samples and experimental conditions (future work will examine the sensitivity of our results to these parameters). Each simulacrum was instantiated using a message supplied in the user role at the beginning of the chat. The experiment was then described to the simulacrum using a prompt in the user role, and thereafter the rounds of play were conducted by alternating messages supplied in the assistant and user roles for the choices made by the participant and their simulated partner respectively. The full set of prompts and sample transcripts are given in the appendices (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), and the complete Python code used to conduct the experiment can be found in the code repository. 2.6 data collection and analysis We collected and recorded data on the communication between the LLM-generated simulacra and their simulated partner during each round of the game. Each chat transcript was analysed using a simple regular expression to extract the choices made by each simulacrum and their partner in each round. The total score was tallied after all rounds had been played. We recorded the mean and standard deviation of the final score across all N chat samples. 2.7 hypotheses Prior to analysing the experimental results we formulated the following testable hypotheses in order to ascertain the capabilities of large-language models are able to operationalise natural language descriptions of selfish versus altruistic behaviour. 2.7.1 hypothesis 1 (h1) Simulacra instantiated with altruistic prompts will exhibit higher cooperation rates compared to those instantiated with self-interested prompts. 2.7.2 hypothesis 2 (h2) Simulacra in the mixed-motivation group will exhibit cooperation rates that fall between those of the cooperative and competitive groups. 2.7.3 hypothesis 3 (h3) Simulacra in all groups will exhibit cooperation rates that are different from the control group. 2.7.4 hypothesis 4 (h4) Hypothesis 5 (H5) Simulacra instantiated with competitive prompts will demonstrate a greater tendency to defect, regardless of their partner’s behavior, compared to other groups. 2.7.5 hypothesis 5 (h5) Simulacra instantiated with altruistic prompts will exhibit a higher degree of cooperation when paired with an unconditionally cooperating partner, compared to when they are paired with an unconditionally defecting partner or a tit-for-tat partner. 2.7.6 hypothesis 6 (h6) Simulacra instantiated with self-interested prompts will exhibit a lower degree of cooperation when paired with an unconditionally cooperating partner, compared to when they are paired with an unconditionally defecting partner or a tit-for-tat partner. 2.7.7 hypothesis 7 (h7) Simulacra instantiated with cooperative or altruistic prompts will exhibit higher cooperation rates when paired with a tit-for-tat partner initiating with cooperation compared to when they are paired with a tit-for-tat partner initiating with defection. 2.7.8 hypothesis 8 (h8) Simulacra instantiated with competitive or self-interested prompts will exhibit lower cooperation rates when paired with a tit-for-tat partner initiating with cooperation compared to when they are paired with a tit-for-tat partner initiating with defection. 3 results The data consists of a total of N = 1800 cases. Each case corresponds to a single play of the iterated PD over six rounds. For each case, we record the following fields:
• Group
• Participant
• Condition
• Score
• Cooperation frequency
• Choices
• Transcript
Tables 1 to 5 give descriptive statistics showing the relationship between the prompt content and emergent behavior in LLM-generated agents, while Figures 1 and 2 show corresponding box-plots. As can be seen from Figure 1a, without having to resort to statistical tests, our results provide clear support for hypothesis 1 through 3 (see section 2.7), demonstrating that simulacra instantiated with cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and self-interested prompts exhibit distinct levels of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. This indicates that LLMs can operationalise natural language descriptions of cooperative and competitive behavior to some
extent. However, from Figure 2 we see that the remaining hypotheses were not supported, suggesting a more complex relationship between prompt content and emergent behavior in LLM-generated agents. Interestingly, the simulacrum from the control group instantiated with “you are a participant in a psychology experiment” (see Table 3, participant T1) exhibited behavior more closely aligned with how real people tend to act in iterated Prisoner’s Dilemmas, suggesting that GPT-3.5 possesses some knowledge about human behavior in such contexts. However, when combined with the other results, it appears that the LLM struggles to generalize this behavior in a nuanced way beyond a superficial ability to cooperate more or less depending on whether the role description is altruistic or selfish. The unexpected pattern of increased cooperation with defectors and decreased cooperation with
cooperators challenges our initial hypotheses and highlights a potential limitation in the LLM’s ability to translate altruism or selfishness into strategies based on conditioned reciprocity. This result suggests that while the agents are sensitive to the general cooperative or competitive nature of the prompts, their capacity to effectively adapt their behavior to their partner’s actions might be more limited. 4 conclusion and future work Our results demonstrate that GPT 3.5 is able, at least to some extent, to operationalise concepts of altruism and selfishness in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. However, most of the simulacra failed to adapt their strategy appropriately in the face of differing levels of cooperation or defection from partners. 5 appendices  5.1 appendix a: detailed description of prompts This appendix provides a comprehensive list of prompts used to instantiate LLM-generated simulacra with varying degrees of cooperation, competitiveness, and other traits. types and characteristics, allowing for a thorough investigation of the impact of prompt features on the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of the simulacra. These prompts were used to generate a diverse range of LLM-generated simulacra, enabling the investigation of various cooperation and competition dynamics in the experimental economics simulations. By exploring the interactions and outcomes that arise from these different personas, our research aims to uncover the factors that influence the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of large language models, with implications for AI alignment and the design of AI systems that better align with human values and societal goals. The initial prompts are of the form “You are [X]. [Y]” where [X] is used to instantiate a simulacra (see below), and [Y] is a description of the task. For example, [X] might be “You are a helpful and cooperative individual who values teamwork and always seeks the best outcome for all parties involved.”
For the prisoner’s dilemma experiments [Y] is:
