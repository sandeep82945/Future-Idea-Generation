Incentive policy optimization of scientific and technological talents and low-carbon economy analysis from the perspective of public health 2. optimization and incentive of s&t talents policy and low-carbon economy analysis method  2.1. classification of s&t talents incentive policies S&T talents policy involves a variety of contents, including the incentive, the use, management, and development of S&T talents, etc. In this study, the S&T talents policy is divided into four types, as displayed in Figure 1. The S&T talents policy can be divided into four types: the flow,
cultivation, incentive, and evaluation policy of S&T talents. 2.1.1. the flow policy of s&t talents The flow of S&T talents mainly covers their introduction and a series of measures to regulate the introduction of relevant skills (8). The introduction policy of S&T talents is aimed at introducing technology personnel, and its principal contents are encouragement, service, support, and management (9). To sum up, the introduction policy of S&T talents refers to the normative criteria for the introduction of relevant skills to meet the needs of local social development under the background of national laws, regulations, and applicable policies to attract and introduce talents (10). 2.1.2. the cultivation policy of s&t talents As the primary productive force, S&T plays an increasingly prominent role and position in society, and S&T talents, as its primary carrier, have become strategic elements of regional development (11). The relevant policy environment influences the cultivation effect of S&T skills. Scientific talent policy is beneficial to the better development of S&T talents. In summary, the cultivation policy of S&T talents stands for the personnel training program formulated to achieve the talents cultivation goal in a specific professional field. The S&T talent cultivation goal is achieved by standardizing talent cultivation behavior (12). Frontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org
FIGURE 1 Classification of the S&T talents policy. 2.1.3. the incentive policy of s&t talents It refers to the policy promoting S&T talents’ working enthusiasm through spiritual, material, or development incentives (13). The spiritual incentive policy of S&T talents is to inspire these talents by maintaining the skills emotionally and recognizing their achievements. By providing convenience and assistance to S&T talents and their families to solve the concerns of these talents in addition to work, the motivation of such skills can be realized (14). The formulation of the S&T talents incentive policy should not only satisfy the demands of the talents maternally but also pay more attention to their spiritual and future development demands (15). 2.1.4. the evaluation policy of s&t talents The evaluation mechanism of the S&T talents evaluation policy is indicated in Figure 2. Because a complete cycle can fully reflect the situation of evaluation objects, the evaluation of S&T talents evaluation policy given PH should be carried out in an appropriate and complete cycle (16). The object of evaluation is the provider of evaluation information, which should be composed of members of government, enterprise, and university organizations (17). The evaluation subject should be selected randomly to ensure the objectivity of the evaluation result. The organizational preparation is mainly to prepare for the evaluation of the S&T talents policy
(18). The implementation of policy evaluation is to ensure the scientific nature and reliability of the results of the S&T talents evaluation policy from the perspective of PH through qualitative or quantitative researchmethods so that the evaluation results become an essential basis for optimizing this policy from the point of PH (19). The feedback mechanism of the S&T talents evaluation policy is demonstrated in Figure 3. From a PH perspective, the evaluation policies of S&T skills would be incomplete without a feedback mechanism. In this perspective, the policy optimization should not only be based on the feedback of the policy evaluation but also on listening to the opinions of the people who implement the policy. Based on the interests of the people, by building a policy information feedback platform, more people can have the opportunity to participate in the process of information feedback on this policy from the viewpoint of PH, to realize the innovation of the existing policy feedback mechanism from relevant perspectives. 2.2. the establishment of the low-carbon economy optimization model The economic output is taken as the decision variable of the LCE optimization model, and the maximum economic output is chosen as the target variable of this model. CO2 emission,
Frontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org
energy consumption, and economic output structures are selected as constraint conditions to solve the optimization model (20). In this section, the economic output of various sectors in China is taken as the decision variable of the optimization model, and the planning model is constructed to maximize the total economic output. Here, this study puts the control of carbon emission into
the constraint to ensure the convenience of solving the model. Then, with energy consumption structure, CO2 emission structure, and economic output structure as constraints, the general linear programming method is used to solve the optimization model. The solution method is the Simplex method and interior method. The model constructs the internal connection among economic growth, energy consumption, and CO2 emission in an intuitive way. By adjusting the economic output of 41 national economy departments, the model finds the optimal output scheme in China based on controlling the total energy consumption and total carbon emission. 2.2.1. the setting of the objective function The expression of the objective function of the optimization problem is as follows:
maxZ = iTx = x1 + x2 + . . . + x41 (1)
x refers to the decision variable; xj stands for the total output of department j according to the input–output table, j = 1, 2, . . . .41; i signifies a scalar whose coefficients are all 1, i = [1, 1, . . . , 1]T . The objective function Z is to all of China’s output of 41 industries for aggregation, representing themaximization of the total output (21). The number and names of industries are exhibited in Table 1. Table 1 details the 41 sectors, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, coal mining and washing industry, oil and gas mining, metal mining and non-metal mining, etc. The calculation of carbon emissions mainly uses Equation (2):
E = AD ∗ EF (2)
AD refers to the consumption of fossil fuels, the use of raw materials, and the electricity purchased or exported in the production process during the accounting period. The unit of gas fuel is 10,000 cubic meters (104 m3, standard state), and the unit of solid or liquid fuel is tons (t). EF stands for the CO2 factor, namely the CO2 coefficient. The emission coefficient of each energy is calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) according to the calorific value of energy combustion, as denoted in Figure 4 (22). Natural gas is measured in tons of CO2/billion m 3. Everything else is tons of CO2/million tons. In Figure 4, the emission coefficient of natural gas is 218,500 tons of CO2/billion m 3, that of raw coal and gasoline is 20,600 tons of CO2/million tons, and 30,000 tons of CO2/million tons. The CO2 emission coefficient of these significant energy sources can be used to calculate the CO2 emission influence of each industry. 2.2.2. setting of constraint condition The set classification of constraint conditions is revealed in Figure 5. 2.2.2.1. total energy consumption constraint This constraint represents the sum of all energy consumed by production activities in all departments, which does not

exceed the established predicted value (23). It is expressed by Equation (2):
iTAex ≤ ef (3)
Ae = diag(β TE). E means the department’s direct energy consumption coefficient matrix; β refers to the conversion coefficient of each energy into standard coal, as outlined in Table 2. βTE represents the total specific energy consumption produced by each department, namely, the comprehensive energy productivity, which is 1 × 41 matrix; ef stands for the predicted energy expenditure of China in 2023 (24). Table 2 presents the energy conversion coefficient. 2.2.2.2. co2 emission constraint The constraint refers to the sum of CO2 emissions from production activities of all sectors, which does not exceed the established predicted value (25), as defined in Equation (3):
iTAcx ≤ cf (4)
Ac = diag(i TC). C indicates the direct CO2 matrix; i TC represents the total amount of CO2 consumed by each department’s
production unit output, which is also a 1 × 41 matrix (26). cf signifies the predicted total CO2 emissions of China in 2023. 2.2.2.3. economic development level constraints This constraint expresses the sum of the added value of all sectors so that the total amount is not lower than the set forecast of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (27). The economic development level constraint is written as Equation (4):
iT(I − A)x ≥ yf (5)
A means the coefficient matrix of the intermediate consumption of the department; I is the identity matrix of 41 × 41; I − A displays the value-added coefficient matrix; yf denotes the predicted total GDP of China in 2023. 2.2.2.4. constraints on the scope of departmental restructuring It can be represented in Equation (5):
lbj ≤ xf ≤ ubj, j = R 41 (6)
lbj and ubj express the lower and upper bound of the output of department j (28). In addition, another purpose of adding this

constraint is to eliminate the extreme conditions in the feasible solution set. 2.2.2.5. rationality constraint xj ≥ 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , 41 (7)
xj ≥ 0 means that the output of all departments must
be non-negative. 2.2.3. stationarity test Generally, the method to test the stationarity of sequence is the Unit root test. In this study, the traditional Augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) test and Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskovo Soyuza (KPSS) test are principally used to ensure the accuracy of the results (29). 2.2.3.1. adf test ADF test is based on the Dickey and Fuller (DF) test to expand, its core problem is to test whether the slope coefficient ρ in Equation (7) is 1. Dxt = α + ρxt−1 + εt (8)
D represents the difference factor; {εt} is a white noise sequence with a mean value of 0, a variance of σ 2, and an Identical Independent Distribution. The original hypothesis H0 of the ADF test is that the sequence {xt} has a unit root, that is ρ = 1, that is, {xt} is a non-stationary sequence (30). It is assumed that the value of the characteristic root P is within the unit circle and the sequence is stable. According to tradition, the statistics constructed are:
t = (ρ̂−ρ) se(ρ̂) (9)
ρ̂ is the estimated value of the parameter ρ obtained by ρ using
the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Under the original assumption, the limiting distribution of the statistic t still obeys the general Gaussian distribution. Still, the convergence rate of the intercept term and the slope term is different. [

Under the alternative hypothesis, regardless of ρ = 0 or |ρ| < 1, The limit distribution of the statistic t is still standard normal. Frontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org

In any hypothesis test, there are two kinds of errors: “false rejection” (Class I error) and “false taking” (Class II error).

w (.) stands for variable-weight functions, and various kernel
functions choose different smooth ways. ADF and KPSS methods are employed to test the stationarity of the three sequences. The results of the two tests are compared in Table 3. Among them, the Autocorrelation function (ACF) lag order is selected by minimizing the Schwarz Information Criteria (SIC) criterion, and the intercept term is used as an exogenous variable. In Table 3, ADF inspection considers that the sequence of GDP, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions after logarithmic treatment is a non-stationary I(1) process. All
three become stationary processes after first-order differences. KPSS inspection considers that no matter which variable, its original sequence after logarithmic is non-stationary, and after first-order difference, the three sequences become stationary. Therefore, all three variables can be considered as I(1) processes. 3. experimental design and performance evaluation  3.1. recommendations for optimizing s&t talents policy from a ph perspective In the view of PH, the recommendations for optimizing the
S&T talents policy are plotted in Figure 6. This study puts forward some suggestions on S&T talents policy from the viewpoint of optimizing PH. It mainly covers establishing a complete policy system, expanding policy coverage, strict implementation of such talent evaluation policy, and improving the guarantee mechanism of the talent introduction policy. Establishing a complete policy system includes clarifying the main body of the policy-making and optimizing the structure of this policy. The expansion of policy coverage includes paying attention to the role of such talents at all levels, implementing the training plan for young scientists, and implementing the S&T talents continuing education project. The strict implementation of the S&T talents evaluation policy involves increasing the publicity and establishing the evaluation mechanism and feedback mechanism of the policy. 3.2. solution of low-carbon economy optimization model in china Matlab has powerful data processing and analysis functions. This study adopts Matlab software to solve the economic output of each department in the expected year, and the overall economic indicators in 2017 and 2022 are obtained, as illustrated in Figure 7. In 2017, the proportion of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in the primary industry was 5.33%, that of energy in the secondary sector was 72.04%, and that of
FIGURE 6 The suggestions for optimizing the S&T talents policy. service in the tertiary industry was 22.63%. In 2022, the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries accounted for 6.09%, 68.44%, and 25.47%. The proportion of the primary sector in the overall economy did not change much. The economic added value and the total output of China’s three major industries are presented in Figure 8. Compared with 2017 (base year), the total economic added value of the three industries reached 61.5 trillion yuan, 15.6 trillion yuan more than that of 2017, the total economic output value of the three sectors achieved 184.8 trillion yuan, 44.19 trillion yuan more than that of 2017. The declining trend of the output of the secondary sector is evident, illustrating that the constraints of energy conservation and emission reduction impact the industrial sector as a whole. The proportion of tertiary industry increased slightly. 3.3. analysis of the influence coe cient of various departments  3.3.1. industrial influence coe cient The industrial influence coefficient from 2016 to 2022 is signified in Figure 9. The industrial influence coefficient of all sectors in China during 2016–2022 is stable. The influence coefficient of the secondary industry is much higher than that of the primary and tertiary industries as a whole, and most of them are more than the average value of social industries. Thus, it can be found that the secondary sector is still the main driving force of the
national economy in China. Among them, the driving effect of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery on China’s economy has been declining yearly, with the influence coefficient dropping from 1.15 in 2016 to 0.67 in 2022. In addition to transportation and storage, the industrial influence coefficient of other departments of the tertiary industry is generally lower than the average level of the national economy. Besides, the driving capacity of the transportation industry for the overall economy also presents a downward trend year after year, from 1.35 in 2016 to 0.97 in 2022. It indicates that the service industry plays an insignificant role in driving China’s overall economy. In the manufacturing industry, the chemical industry, metal smelting, and calendering industry have the strongest pulling force, with an average influence of more than 2 in 2016–2022. While light manufacturing industries, such as textiles, wood processing, and furniture manufacturing, have a low pull on the overall economy and a downward trend. Among the products and services of the mining industry, the industrial influence of all four sectors was low, maintaining around 0.5 between 2016 and 2022. 3.3.2. the influence coe cient of co2 emission The influence coefficient of CO2 emission during 2016–2022 is portrayed in Figure 10. During 2016–2022, except for a few sectors, the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of the added value of all industries in China appeared a downward trend, which means that the carbon productivity of each sector increased with each passing year, illustrating that the “low carbon development” trend of China’s economy is generally good. In terms of industrial influence and
Frontiers in PublicHealth 08 frontiersin.org
CO2 emission influence, the driving role of the secondary industry is much higher than that of the tertiary and primary industries, and most of them are resource-intensive industries. However, the effect of the tertiary industry on the overall economy has gradually emerged and expanded. In conclusion, the secondary industry will remain a pillar industry in China during the 2016– 2022 period. But in terms of trends, the influence of services has risen slightly over this period, while manufacturing has tended to decline. By comprehensively considering the CO2 emission and industrial influence coefficients, China should give priority to developing industries with low carbon influence. The scientific development of these sectors with high carbon emissions and high industrial impact has been promoted, mainly through technological improvement to reduce and limit high CO2 emissions of these industries. 4. discussion The first section is the countermeasures and proposals of S&T talents policy from the perspective of optimizing PH. There are four significant countermeasures, namely, the establishment of the S&T talents policy system, the expansion of coverage groups, the implementation of evaluation policies, and the improvement of the introduction of safeguards, each deepens the strategies of two to three minor aspects, respectively. In the second section, by solving the LCE optimization model of China, it is concluded that the proportion of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in the overall economy has little change. In contrast, the output of the secondary industry has a relatively obvious downward trend, showing that the constraints of energy conservation and emission
Frontiers in PublicHealth 09 frontiersin.org
reduction have an influence on the industrial sector. In the third section, through the analysis of the influence coefficient of various industries, the industrial influence coefficient of all sectors in China during 2016–2022 is stable. Generally, the influence coefficient of the secondary sector is much higher than that of the primary and tertiary industries, and most of them override the average value of social industries. Thereby, it can be drawn that the secondary sector is still the main driving force of the national economy. Liu et al. (31) implemented an energy-saving and emission-reduction decision optimization model from the perspective of a low-carbon supply chain of auto parts (31). Compared with this study, it can be studied from the standpoint of energy conservation and emission reduction and added the perspective of industrial influence. 5. conclusion The direct purpose of LCE is to reduce emissions of CO2 and other GHGs under the premise of ensuring a certain economic growth rate. Its essence is to optimize the industrial structure, improve energy efficiency, and achieve the goal of low-carbon development. China is currently facing multiple challenges such as improving people’s quality of life, stabilizing economic growth, and limiting the total amount of CO2 emissions. S&T talents incentive policy has vital theoretical value and practical significance for China to realize the transformation of LCE and SD. Firstly, from four aspects of S&T talents evaluation flow, cultivation, and incentive of S&T talents, the study explores incentive and optimization of the S&T talents policy and puts forward effective suggestions. Secondly, a Chinese LCE optimization model is constructed. Using MATLAB software, the economic output of each sector in the expected year can be solved to obtain overall economic indicators for 2017 and 2022. Finally, the output influence of each industry and CO2 influence are analyzed. The results of the study are as follows: (1) From the point of view of PH, the suggestions and countermeasures of the S&T talents policymainly consist of four parts: expanding the coverage group of this policy, establishing a complete policy system, perfecting the safeguard mechanism of such talents introduction policy, and strictly implementing these talents evaluation policy. (2) Compared with 2017, the total economic output of the three industries reached 184.8 trillion yuan, 44.19 trillion yuan higher than that of 2017. (3) Overall, the influence coefficient of the secondary industry is much stronger than that of the primary and tertiary sectors, and the majority exceed the mean value of social industries. Consequently, it can be concluded that the secondary industry is still the main driving force of the national economy in China. The disadvantage is that in the comparable price input– output model used in this study, the price deflator of the tertiary sector is determined by the added value coefficient. Due to data limitations, the added value coefficient in the statistical yearbook
cannot cover all sectors. Thus, the added value coefficient of other service industries is used to deflate the remaining industries, which will slightly affect the accuracy of the data. Besides, price factors such as carbon prices and policy trends of various provinces need to be incorporated into the relevant influencing factors in the study content, so as to achieve a more complete development strategy for China’s LCE.
