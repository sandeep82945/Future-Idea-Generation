To address challenges associated with climate change, population growth and decline in international trade linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining whether national crop production can meet populations’ requirements and contribute to socio-economic resilience is crucial. Three crop models and three global climate models were used in conjunction with predicted population changes. Compared with wheat production in 2000–2010, total production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020–2030, 2030–2040 and 2040–2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. However, when considering population and climate changes, the predicted per capita production values were 125.3 ± 0.3, 127.1 ± 2.3 and 128.8 ± 2.7 kg during the 2020–2030, 2030–2040, 2040–2050 periods under RCP4.5, or 126.2 ± 0.7, 128.7 ± 2.5, and 131.0 ± 4.1 kg, respectively, under RCP8.5. These values do not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level (127.9 ± 1.3 kg). The average per capita production in Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions declined. In contrast, per capita production in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and MiddleLower Yangtze Valleys subregions increased. The results suggest that climate change will increase total wheat production in China, but population change will partly offset the benefits to the grain market. In addition, domestic grain trade will be influenced by both climate and population changes. Wheat supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas. 1 introduction The COVID-19 pandemic, associated disruption of food supply chains and food production, together with accompanying reductions in incomes, have exacerbated food insecurity in many countries (World Bank, 2020). Measures to control COVID-19 have included complete lockdown, international border closures, and transport restrictions that have heavily affected global food supply chains (Workie
et al., 2020). The mobility restrictions have inevitably had negative effects on global food security (Zhang et al., 2022). For example, in early stages of the pandemic, 21 countries imposed export restrictions, which reduced the volume of globally traded food by ca. 4% in terms of caloric value (Laborde et al., 2020). These effects of the pandemic will lead to more people dying of hunger in developing countries, as ca. 40% of the population may lack staple food (Khan et al., 2020), and impact food security through disruption of food supplies from developing countries in developed countries (Workie et al., 2020). Hence, for example, the pandemic has raised food insecurity for low-income Americans (Fang et al., 2021). According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2021), 690 million people (8.9% of the global population) were undernourished in 2019, and the pandemic likely increased this number. Therefore, ensuring self-sufficient food production is important for every country under conditions such as * Li Wang wangli5208@nwsuaf.edu.cn 1 College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China 2 State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau, Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China

those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including slowdowns in food imports. However, climate and population changes will influence food security and self-sufficient of food production in many countries. Since the industrial revolution, global climate has been significantly affected by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, with associated effects on the water cycle (Wu et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2020), river flows (Gudmundsson et al., 2021), agricultural irrigation (Zhang et al., 2021), as well as many other ecologically, sociologically and economically important processes. As crops’ growth, agricultural production is highly sensitive to climate change (Ikhuoso et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2015). For example, Liu et al. (2021) concluded that wheat yields will significantly change in at least half of the planting area in the world due to climate change, and on the North China Plain, climate change is predicted to increase wheat yields, but reduce maize yields (Xiao et al., 2020). In West Africa, irrigated rice yields are expected to increase by about 25% due to changes in temperature and CO2 fertilization (van Oort & Zwart, 2017), and in India, climate change is predicted to increase potato production from about 24 million to 37 million tonnes between 2010 and 2030 (Scott et al., 2019). Moreover, as the population grows, the need for food is increasing. For example, relative to 2005 levels, a 60–110% increase in global food production may be needed to meet the growing demand by 2050 (Tilman et al., 2011). Thus, there will increasing pressure on agriculture to produce enough food to meet people’s needs (Khan et al., 2020), and ensuring that their growing populations have sufficient food supplies will be highly important for all countries as the climate changes (Bowles et al., 2020). Therefore, rigorous evaluation of the effects of likely climate and population changes on food supplies and security is crucial. An important element of food security is per capita production of food (Funk & Brown, 2009), and to estimate this variable accurately, robust projections of crop production and population growth are required. Many methods have been applied to study effects of climate change on crop yields. These include FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments, warming experiments in OTCs (open-top chambers), statistical analyses of historical data, and use of crop models such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator), DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies), EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate), and WheatGrow (Rashid et al., 2019; Schlenker & Lobell, 2010; Wang et al., 2020b). Phenomena examined in FACE experiments and OTC experiments have included fertilization effects of CO2 concentrations, crops’ nitrogen uptake, the effects of coelevation of CO2 and temperature (Lenka et al., 2021; Pleijel & Högy, 2015; Wang et al., 2020b). Statistical models are widely applied in analyses at large temporal
and spatial scales (Lobell & Burke, 2010). Combining crop models and statistical models, Lobell et al. (2005) found that measured increases in wheat yield since 1980 in Mexico could be mainly attributed to climate change. Moreover, using statistical analyses, Lobell and Field (2007) estimated that increasing temperatures between 1980 and 2002 had caused a combined annual loss of global wheat, barley and maize yields of approximately 40 Mt. Generally, the use of crop models in climate change research has gradually increased as they have developed. Their use is time-efficient and economical than other methods. In addition, their coupling with global climate models (GCMs) enables predictions of effects of climate change on crop yields (Feng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020b), nitrogen contribution efficiencies (Liu et al., 2020a), suitable planting area changes (Yang et al., 2015), and other factors. Many crop models have been used in climate change research, such as the APSIM (Bahri et al., 2019; Saddique et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020c), DSSAT (Ngwira et al., 2014; Phetheet et al., 2021), WOFOST (Gilardelli et al., 2018), EPIC (Feng & Hao, 2020; Niu et al., 2009), and WheatGrow (Lv et al., 2013) models. Different models have different structures, and the resulting simulations sometimes differ (Tao et al., 2017a). Using an ensemble of crop models is an optimal way to overcome the shortcomings of different models and reflect the influence of climate change on crops (Asseng et al., 2019; Martre et al., 2015). For example, Ye et al. (2020) used four crop models and four GCMs to quantify the change in total wheat production under climate change. For population projections, Malthusian population growth and logistic population growth modeling are two classical approaches (Tong et al., 2020). However, small population and abundant resources are required for Malthusian population growth, as it is assumed to have no limitation. This does not apply to logistic population growth modeling (Tong et al., 2020), which has been applied (inter alia) to estimate population changes (Chen et al., 2022), spread of the SARSCoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 (Almeshal et al., 2020), and mortality rates of patients (Jaimes et al., 2005). China has a very large population and limited resources. Thus, for country-scale population projections, logistic regression is much more suitable than Malthusian modeling. In summary, research on effects of climate change on crop growth has been conducted using many methods, in many areas, and under many scenarios. However, as population increases, the demand for crop production is growing. Thus, to assist efforts to address challenges associated with climate change and population growth, determining whether crop production can meet populations’ requirements and contribute to national socio-economic resilience is essential. Such research is especially crucial in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. The aim of the study presented here was to contribute to efforts to elucidate coupled effects of climate
change and population growth on food security, focusing on production of wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in China. Wheat is an important crop in the global grain market, and the third most highly produced crop in the world (Asseng et al., 2011). Globally, 750 million tons of wheat was harvested in 2019 (Zhang et al., 2022), accounting for ca. 20% of the calories and proteins globally harvested (Shiferaw et al., 2013). It is also the main food source for more than 40% of the global population (Zhang et al., 2022). China has the largest wheat-producing area, accounting for 17.4% of total global wheat production (FAO, 2021), and had a population of 1.41 billion people in 2020 (National Bureau of Statistics of China), accounting for 18% of the global population (the largest population in the world). Thus, ensuring the food security of China is essential for robust global development and stability of global food security. In this study, three crop models (APSIM, EPIC, and WheatGrow) and three GCMs (ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM11-M, and MRI-CGCM3) were used to predict potential wheat yield changes in China. In addition, population changes were predicted by logistic regression at country scale, as well as both logistic regression and unary linear regression at prefecture-level city scale. The study had three specific objectives. First, to predict potential wheat yield changes in China. Second, to determine the regional variations about the influence of climate and population changes on per capita potential production of wheat. Third, to determine whether per capita potential production will increase or decrease in the future at both country and prefecturelevel city scales. Such research is particularly important for maintaining national self-sufficiency in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, or another major disruptor of international trade (e.g. war). 2 materials and methods  2.1 study region The study region comprised 18 provinces and provincelevel municipalities. Planting areas in these provinces published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (http:// www. stats. gov. cn) indicate that the study region accounts for 95% of the wheat-planting area in the country, in total. The total area of the study region is 4.16 million square kilometers, covering about 43% of China’s land, and it hosts 205 prefecture-level cities. Five subregions were identified according to Chinese agricultural zoning standards (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China, Fig. 1), designated the Gansu-Xinjiang (GX), Loess Plateau (LP), Huanghuai (HH), Southwestern China (SW), and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys (YV) subregions. Spring wheat is planted in Gansu, Ningxia autonomous region, and the southern part of the Xinjiang autonomous region. Winter wheat is planted in the other regions. 2.2 data sources Experiment crop data were obtained from 51 agrometeorological stations operated by the National Meteorological Information Center (http:// data. cma. cn/, CMA) and Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (http:// www. cern. ac. cn, CERN), including yields, biomass, and phenology (sowing, jointing, and maturity dates) of wheat at each station. Management data acquired included the sowing density, irrigation and fertilization conditions. Names, locations and time series of the data acquired from these agro-meteorological
1 3
stations are presented in Table S1. Most of the wheat yield and phenological information was from 2000 to 2013. Missing values were neglected in this study. Crop data were used in crop models’ calibration and validation. Historic daily climate conditions recorded by meteorological stations from the CMA, including sunshine hours, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity values during research period. Data from 112 meteorological stations were included in this study. Moreover, as solar radiation is an essential parameter for crop models, sunshine hours were transformed into solar radiation values with the Angstrom formula (Jones, 1992). Soil data–including the soil type, pH, organic carbon content, bulk density, particle size and other properties–were obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database (https:// westdc. westg is. ac. cn/ data) and Soil Science Dataset (https:// vdb3. soil. csdb. cn/). Data on the wheat planting areas from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from MAPSPAM (https:// www. mapsp am. info/, Fig. S1). It includes the distribution of wheat in China. For future climate data, the World Climate Research Program’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-5 (CMIP5) dataset was used (Taylor et al., 2011). Future daily meteorological data were downscaled with inverse distanceweighted interpolation. Then NWAI-WG was used to generate daily climate data. This downscaled method and dataset, proposed by Liu and Zuo (2012), has been applied and described in detail in many studies (Ruan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015, 2019). Three GCMs were used to represent the future climate: ACCESS1-0 (AC1, Australia), BCC-CSM11-M (BC2, China), and MRI-CGCM3 (MR3, Japan). Two sources of population data were used in this research. At the country scale, population data during 1990–2020 were derived from National Bureau of Statistics (http:// www. stats. gov. cn/). At the prefecture-level city scale, population data during 2000–2020 were from WorldPop (https:// www. world pop. org/). Data of WorldPop calibrated with historical records. 2.3 crop models The APSIM model is a comprehensive model that is often used to simulate the biophysical processes of crops (Keating et al., 2003). It is helpful for studying appropriate agricultural measures for food security and climate change adaptations (https:// www. apsim. info). The EPIC model has been widely applied in crop yield and soil organic carbon simulations (Liu et al., 2007; Thomson et al., 2006). It has also been applied in research on the influence of climate change on crop yields (Chavas et al., 2009). EPIC includes nine submodels and can simulate plant growth, soil moisture, and nutrient cycles. WheatGrow was initially proposed by staff members of Nanjing Agricultural University, China, and
uses the physiological development time to simulate crop growth and dry matter formation in daily steps (Ye et al., 2020). These three crop models have been widely used to study agricultural effects of climate change (Bai et al., 2019; Feng & Hao, 2020; Lv et al., 2013). APSIM 7.10, WheatGrow, and WinEPIC software packages (each of which has a graphical user interface) were applied in this study. Parameters used in models are shown in Table S2. 2.4 model calibration and evaluation Grain yield and maturity date were chosen to evaluate the models’ accuracy, and the trial-and-error method was applied to obtain appropriate crop parameters. R2, root mean square error (RMSE), model efficiency (ME), and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values were calculated to assess the models’ accuracy, using the following formulas:
Here, SSR is the regression sum of squares, SST is the total sum of squares, SSE is the error sum of square; Si is the predicted value, S the average of the predicted value; Mi the observed value; and M the average of the observed value. To assess the population projections’ accuracy, R2, RMSE, and nRMSE values were used. 2.5 logistic regression To predict country scale population change, logistic regression (more precisely, a logistic competitive biological model) was applied. In this model, exponential growth in early stages is followed by steady growth and subsequently a decline, according to the following equation:

population data. The Chinese government implemented the one-child policy since 1980s. Therefore, to avoid influence of policy, Chinese population data from 1990–2010 were used to establish the logistic regression. Chen et al. (2022) applied a similar timeframe. Population data from 2010–2020 was used for validation. One of the problems of logistic model is that long-term prediction error fluctuation is relatively large (Chen et al., 2022). Therefore, the population projections were limited to 2021–2050. At the country scale, the logistic regression formula applied was:
Here, X(t) denotes the population (108), and t is year (with 1980 treated as 1, 1981 as 2 and so on). Logistic regression is not sufficient to model population changes in the prefecture-level cities, so logistic regression and unary linear regression models were compared and used for the population projections. Data from 2000 to 2015 were used to estimate parameters, then data from 2016 to 2020 were used to validate the logistic regression and unary linear regression. Unary linear regression and logistic regression proved suitable for modeling the population changes in 147 and 58 prefecture-level cities, respectively. 2.6 design of the simulations After models’ calibration and validation, three crop models were used to project the potential yield change in the future. Insufficient supplies of water and nutrients can radically perturb effects of climate change. Therefore, simulations were run without water, nitrogen, potassium, or phosphorus stress. In the relative research (Gao et al., 2020), ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM1-1-M, and MRI-CGCM3 were chosen to represent the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of 33 GCMs after preprocessing according to mean temperature in northern China (the major planting area of wheat). Therefore, these three GCMs were also applied in this study. The spatial resolution of ACCESS1-0, BCCCSM1-1-M, and MRI-CGCM3 are 1.875° × 1.25°, 1.125° × 1.12°, and 1.125° × 1.1213°, respectively. Historical and future periods were separated into four time periods: 2000–2010, 2020–2030, 2030–2040, and 2040–2050, designated baseline, 2030S, 2040S and 2050S, respectively. Two representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways4.5) and RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways8.5), were considered. In the RCP4.5 scenario, radiative forcing reaches 4.5 W/m2, and the CO2 concentration reaches 538 ppm by 2100 with governmental efforts. In the RCP8.5 scenario, radiative forcing reaches 8.5 W/m2, and the CO2 concentration reaches 936 ppm by 2100 with no adaption to climate

change (Vuuren et al., 2011). Assumed CO2 concentrations were calculated as follows (where y denotes a specific year):
According to these equations, the CO2 concentrations in the three time periods were 425, 448, and 471 ppm under RCP4.5 and 432, 470, and 519 ppm under RCP8.5 (380 ppm for baseline). After crop models simulation, inverse distance weighted interpolation was used to obtain raster data for potential yields. This is a widely used method for creating yield maps (Betzek et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2020b) used it to interpolate rice yields across the entire study region to generate a raster map. Yang et al. (2013) used it to interpret spatial distribution of evapotranspiration, and Ye et al. (2020) used it to research changes in wheat yields under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming. Therefore, in this study, inverse distance weighted interpolation was applied, and Geostatistical Analyst of the ArcGIS was applied to estimate the associated errors of inverse distance weighted interpolation for cross-validation. For this, the relationship between observed and predicted values during the baseline period was calculated. The yield and planting area grid resolutions in ArcGIS were 1.2 and 5 arcmin resolution, respectively. Subsequently, by coupling the potential yield and planting area data, the raster calculator in ArcGIS software was applied to obtain predicted total wheat production. Per capita potential production at country scale was predicted to estimate effects of climate and population changes on food security, using the following equation:
Here, W is the per capita potential production (kg), ygrid,i is the value of each grid cell in the raster map of the yield (kg/ha), pgrid,i is the value of each grid cell in the raster map of the planting area (ha), n is the number of datapoints, and pop is the population. The spatial variation in changes in per capita wheat production was also analyzed. Prefecture-level city scale populations during 2020–2050 were estimated using logistic regression and unary linear regression models. In addition, through coupling with the average total production during 2020–2050 under two RCP scenarios, the spatial variations in per capita wheat production in the future was calculated. Finally, changes in per capita wheat production

at prefecture-level city scale in the future, relative to the baseline, were analyzed. The modeling framework of the study is illustrated in Fig. 2. 2.7 random forest regression Wheat yields were predicted in the absence of water, nitrogen, potassium, or phosphorus stress to avoid effects of insufficient nutrient and water supplies. Therefore, the determinants of potential production were four relevant climatic variables: maximum temperature (TMAX), minimum temperature (TMIN), solar radiation (SAD), and carbon dioxide concentration (CO2). However, multicollinearity detected substantial collinearity of these climate variables, which should always be considered (Li et al., 2021). The condition indices of TMAX, TMIN, SAD and CO2 were 5.271 (< 10), 28.103 (> 10), 44.880 (> 10), and 49.371 (> 10), respectively. Therefore, to avoid collinearity effects, random forest regression (RFR) was chosen to conduct the statistical analysis. This is a multi-tree ensemble prediction machine learning method, in which a program (here the “randomForest” package in R programing language) randomly samples data points from the original dataset, then an algorithm establishes a regression tree for each point. Finally, by calculating averages of all tress, new data are predicted by RFR (Dai et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2018). In the RFR procedure applied
here, the number of trees was 1000, and a parameter called “IncNodePurity” was used to assess the importance of all included factors. 3 results  3.1 model evaluation Model evaluation showed that their performance was acceptable (Figs. S2 and 3). The wheat yields predicted by the WheatGrow, APSIM, and EPIC models in the validation set had: RMSE values of 882, 885, and 870 kg/ha; ME values of 0.69, 0.69, and 0.70; R2 values of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.72; and nRMSE values of 15.9, 16.5, and 16.1%, respectively. The maturity dates predicted by the models had: RMSE values of 5.7, 5.3, and 6.5 d; ME values of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.93; R2 values of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95; and nRMSE values of 3.5, 3.2, and 3.9%, respectively (Fig. 3). In addition, at the prefecture-level city scale, logistic regression and unary linear regression models provided satisfactory predictions of population change for the validation sets, with: R2 values of 0.85 and 0.92; RMSE values of 8.6 × 105 and 3.8 × 105; and nRMSE values of 16.9% and 8.2%, respectively. Reliability parameters of the inverse distance weighted interpolation are shown in Fig. S3. Measured and predicted yields were strongly significantly related (P < 0.001), with R2, RMSE and nRMSE values of 0.72, 918 kg/ha and
1 3
12.0%, respectively. Therefore, the approach was suitable for the presented yield interpolation and prediction. 3.2 temperature changes Here, and in the following text, data in x ± y format are means ± standard errors. Compared with temperatures recorded from 1981 to 2010, the predicted temperatures in the study regions increased with time (Fig. S4). Under RCP4.5, from 2020 to 2050, predicted increases in TMAX in the LP, HH, YV, SW, and GX subregions were 0.97 ± 0.06 °C, 0.99 ± 0.04 °C, 1.19 ± 0.05 °C, 1.08 ± 0.07 °C and 1.00 ± 0.04 °C, respectively. Predicted increases in TMIN in these subregions were 1.00 ± 0.05 °C, 0.96 ± 0.07 °C, 0.96 ± 0.05 °C, 0.91 ± 0.05 °C, and 0.98 ± 0.05 °C, respectively. Under RCP8.5, from 2020 to 2050, predicted increases in TMAX values in the LP, HH, YV, SW, and GX subregions were 1.13 ± 0.06 °C, 1.21 ± 0.05 °C, 1.32 ± 0.06 °C, 1.16 ± 0.08 °C and 1.21 ± 0.05 °C, respectively, and predicted increases in the TMIN values were 1.17 ± 0.05 °C, 1.28 ± 0.08 °C, 1.06 ± 0.05 °C, 1.00 ± 0.06 °C, and 1.15 ± 0.06 °C, respectively. The average TMAX increase in the northern Chinese subregions (LP, HH, and GX) was 0.99 ± 0.03 °C, significantly smaller than in southern China (YV and SW) under RCP4.5 (1.12 ± 0.05 °C, P < 0.05). In contrast, the increase in TMIN in
northern China was 1.20 ± 0.04 °C, significantly larger than in southern China (1.02 ± 0.04 °C, P < 0.01, Fig. 4) under RCP8.5. 3.3 potential yields under climate change According to the outputs of three crop models, XJ, HH, and YV subregions showed high yields, while LP and SW showed low yields (Figs. S5–7). The potential yield was highest in HH and lowest in SW, with averages of 9211 ± 90 and 5556 ± 360 kg/ha in the baseline period (Fig. 5a). The outputs also indicate that potential yields will increase with climate change in all five subregions in the future (Fig. 6). The predicted increases in the HH subregion were 414 ± 41 (2030S), 665 ± 44 (2040S), and 839 ± 41 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP4.5 and 472 ± 42 (2030S), 758 ± 42 (2040S), and 969 ± 41 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP8.5. The predicted increases in the YV subregion were 194 ± 44 (2030S), 430 ± 42 (2040S), and 606 ± 53 (2050S) kg/ ha under RCP4.5 and 308 ± 41 (2030S), 541 ± 44 (2040S), and 758 ± 48 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP8.5. The predicted increases in the SW subregion were 542 ± 50 (2030S), 687 ± 44 (2040S), and 855 ± 54 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP4.5 and 613 ± 40 (2030S), 856 ± 43 (2040S), and 1043 ± 50 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP8.5. The predicted

increases in the LP subregion were 415 ± 82 (2030S), 609 ± 71 (2040S), and 729 ± 77 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP4.5 and 442 ± 90 (2030S), 721 ± 72 (2040S), and 921 ± 77 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP8.5. The predicted increases in the GX subregion were 422 ± 103 (2030S), 488 ± 117 (2040S), and 562 ± 118 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP4.5 and 329 ± 80 (2030S), 502 ± 99 (2040S), and 607 ± 120 (2050S) kg/ha under RCP8.5. The area in which the yield was larger than 7710 kg/ha (the average yield at the 112 stations during the baseline period) increased from 57.4% (in the baseline period) to 60.8% (2030S), 62.4% (2040S), and 63.2% (2050S) under RCP4.5 and to 61.3% (2030S), 62.9% (2040S), and 63.8% (2050S) under RCP8.5 (Table 1). According to the random forest regression the relative importance of the considered factors for yield increased in the order TMAX > SAD > TMIN > CO2 in the LP and HH subregion, SAD > TMIN > TMAX > CO2 in the YV and SW subregion, and TMAX > TMIN > SAD > CO2 in the GX subregion. 3.4 changes in total potential wheat production and per capita potential production The population growth rate will slow in the future according to the logistic regression model (Fig. 7a), which had a R2 value of 0.98 for the validation period (Fig. 7b). With
climate change, it significantly increased (P < 0.05) by 6.29 ± 1.5 Mt (2030S), 11.8 ± 4.5 Mt (2040S), and 15.4 ± 5.2 Mt (2050S) compared with the baseline level under RCP4.5. It also significantly increased (P < 0.05) by 8.55 ± 2.2 Mt (2030S), 14.2 ± 5.0 Mt (2040S), and 18.4 ± 7.2 Mt (2050S) compared with the baseline level under RCP8.5 (Fig. 7c). In the course of 2020–2050, the increase was predicted to constitute about 57.1% (HH), 11.8% (LP), 12.1% (YV), 10.6% (SW) and 8.4% (GX) of the total production increase under RCP4.5 and about 55.2% (HH), 12.1% (LP), 8.0% (YV), 12.8% (SW) and 11.9% (GX) of the total production increase under RCP8.5. The per capita potential production was found to be 127.9 ± 1.3 kg during the baseline period, and it did not significantly change (P > 0.05) in the future projections. For example, per capita potential production was 125.3 ± 0.3 kg (2030S), 127.1 ± 2.3 kg (2040S), and 128.8 ± 2.7 kg (2050S) under RCP4.5 and 126.2 ± 0.7 kg (2030S), 128.7 ± 2.5 kg (2040S), and 131.0 ± 4.1 kg (2050S) under RCP8.5 if considering population and climate changes (Fig. 7d). However, when only considering the influence of climate change, the per capita production amounts were 132.8 ± 0.3, 137.0 ± 2.5, and 139.8 ± 2.9 kg during the 2030S, 2040S and 2050S periods under RCP4.5, respectively, and 134.5 ± 0.8, 138.8 ± 2.7 and 142.1 ± 4.4 kg during these periods under RCP8.5. These values were significantly larger than baseline value (P < 0.05). 1 3 3.5 spatial distribution of per capita potential production As shown in Fig. 8, per capita potential production of wheat showed spatial distribution. In baseline period (Fig. 8a), the HH and LP subregion showed higher per capita production. And SW and YV showed lower per capita production. At the prefecture-level cities scale, during this period the average per capita wheat production in LP, HH, GX, SW and YV subregions was 266, 346, 232, 108 and 175 kg, respectively. In the climate and population change scenarios, the average per capita production in LP and GX subregions declined (under RCP4.5 by 2.8 and 11.8%, respectively, and under RCP8.5 by 1.5 and 11.1%, respectively). In contrast, per capita production in the HH, SW, and YV subregions increased by 1.3, 32.2, and 19.2%, respectively, under RCP4.5, and by 2.3, 35.2 and 21.1% under RCP8.5. Details of the spatial distributions are shown in Fig. S8. Overall, in northern and southern parts of the wheat planting area, per capita wheat production declined and increased, respectively. 4 discussion  4.1 impact of climate and population changes on the potential wheat production The results indicate that climate change will have different effects in the five studied subregions. The largest increases in total potential yield were in HH, the subregion with the largest planting area, accounting for 57.1 and 55.2% of the total production increases under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, during 2020–2050. This is consistent with conclusions of Ye et al. (2020), that potential wheat yields in HH would increase by ca. 4.6 and 11.7 Mt with 1.5 and 2.0 °C warming, respectively. This clearly indicates that HH, the main wheat production area, will continue to be the most important wheat growing area and account for more wheat production than the other subregions in the future. The findings are also consistent with findings by Tao et al. (2017b), that the wheat yield in the HH subregion benefited historically from increases in the minimum temperature. To reduce the uncertainties in the results, three crop models and three GCMs were used to predict changes in the potential yield of wheat. Wang et al. (2020a) found that the main sources of uncertainty in climate-crop modeling were crop models in China and GCMs in Australia. Coefficient of variation (CV) of the different crop models and different GCMs were calculated in this study. Using the same GCM with different crop models, the CV was 3.1%. Using the same crop model with different GCMs, the CV was 0.9%. This result was similar to the reported by Ye et al. (2020), whose study demonstrated that wheat yields simulated under the same GCM by different crop models had a larger
variation than those simulated under the same crop model by different GCMs in China. Without considering population growth, the annual per capita production amounts were significantly higher (p < 0.05), under both climate scenarios, than baseline levels. However, when considering population growth, the corresponding annual per capita production amounts did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level. Comparison of the changes in predicted per capita production with and without population growth indicates that the anticipated benefit of climate change for food security may be weakened by population change. However, the population change may not cause food crises, as no significant reduction in per capita production was predicted. Policies of the Chinese government are intended to ensure that net carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2030 and fall to zero by 2060. Increases in soil organic carbon storage were observed in farmland soil in China during 1980–2000, and farmland soil may be able to absorb approximately 1.03 Pg carbon in the next 30–50 years (Yu et al., 2021). Moreover, with increasing wheat yields under climate change, more carbon will be needed in the process of crop growth (Kimball & Idso, 1983; van der Kooi et al., 2016). Thus, climate change may assist efforts to meet the target dates for peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality. 4.2 relationships between climate variables and potential wheat yield Atmospheric CO2 concentration can increase the photosynthetic rates, biomass formation, and crop yields (Deryng et al., 2016). As a C3 plant, wheat receives more benefits from CO2 increases than some other crops that are C4 plants (Kang et al., 2002). In addition, some studies have shown that 9800–10600 3.9 10.9 12.2 15.8 9.2 11.8 22.9  9000–9800 21.0 29.8 29.9 27.5 31.6 31.6 21.5  8200–9000 24.0 7.9 8.6 8.5 9.6 8.9 8.5  7400–8200 9.3 10.0 8.6 7.8 8.9 7.5 7.5  6600–7400 11.0 15.5 16.0 16.7 15.8 17.5 17.1  5800–6600 13.6 7.7 7.1 7.9 8.3 7.6 9.3  5000–5800 8.3 10.6 10.2 8.7 10.4 8.8 6.3 1 3
temperature increases are more beneficial for wheat growth in relatively cool regions than in warmer regions (Wang et al., 2017). This is consistent with findings of this study, that increases in LP and HH (the cooler subregions) will be
larger than those in YV and SW (the warmer subregions). Ye et al. (2020) found that the potential wheat yields in SW subregions would decrease while those in other subregions would increase under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming. These
findings partly conflict with results of this study, which may be due to differences in the GCM models used and time periods considered. Moreover, according to Araya et al. (2020), elevated CO2 concentrations have weaker effects on wheat yields in areas with relatively high temperatures. This may cause the increases in yield in the SW subregion to be smaller than those in other subregions (Ye et al., 2020). According to the results of RFR (Table 2), the influences of climatic variables on wheat yield had spatial differences. For the LP and HH subregions, the influence of TMAX was larger than that of SAD. For the SW and YV subregions of southern China, the influence of SAD was larger than that of TMIN. This may contribute to the differences in the solar radiation and temperature distributions in China. In southern China, sunshine duration of spring, summer, autumn, and winter were smaller than northern China (Xiong et al., 2020). Therefore, in southern China, solar radiation is lower than northern China (Feng & Wang, 2021; Feng et al., 2021). At the same time, temperature in southern China is warmer than those in northern China due to latitude. Therefore, for wheat growth in southern China, SAD is a more important limiting factor than temperature. The importance of SAD in southern China was larger than that of temperature in RFR analysis. 4.3 uncertainties of the results A premise of this study was that the planting area would not change in the future, so in the upscaling process it was assumed that the planting area would remain the same as the area recorded during 2000–2010 in the future. However, previous studies indicate that suitable planting areas will change under climate change. Gao et al. (2020) concluded that maize-wheat double-cropping systems will move toward the northeast and northwest of China in the future. In addition, Yang et al. (2015) found that northern shifts in suitable planting areas under climate change will result in a 2.2% increase in the Chinese production of three major crops (maize, wheat and rice). Therefore, if the increase in suitable planting area is also taken into account, national wheat production will increase further. Changes in cultivar and sowing date can also significantly influence wheat yields. For example, Bai et al. (2016) found that cultivar renewal improved wheat yields by 6.5–27.8%, and according to Sun et al. (2018) it could increase wheat yields by 6.93, 17.69, 24.87, and 52.72% in Northern China, the Yellow and Huai River Valleys, the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys, and Southwestern China, respectively. Sun et al. (2007) found that sowing delays significantly reduced winter wheat yields, by 0.5% per day. However, neither cultivar renewal nor adaptation management, both of which may be undertaken by farmers in the future, were considered in this study. The other main uncertainties of this study are the population increases. Population changes are affected by many factors, especially government policy. Regression analysis provided satisfactory results for the historical data and predicted a slow increase in the Chinese population. However, prediction was limited to about 30 years. This is too short for long-term national and global policies. A more comprehensive approach, such as a machine learning method, with the ability to take the birth rate, death rate, and other factors into account would be more favorable. In addition, in this study only the national production of wheat in China was projected, and changes in production of other crops and crops in other countries were ignored. Clearly, more comprehensive evaluation of the production of major crops in both China and elsewhere is essential for rigorous determination of the relationship of food security and climate change. 4.4 implications As shown by the calculated spatial distributions of per capita wheat production in the future in section 3.5, and Fig. 8, per capita wheat production was higher in the northern part of the research area (HH, LP, and GX subregions) than in the southern part (SW and YV subregions). Notably, the wheat production in most areas of the SW and LP subregions was too low to meet requirements of the local population, and the per capita wheat production in these subregions was lower than the Chinese average. Therefore, three types of regional food security and domestic grain trade were recognized in China. First, most areas in LP, HH, and GX subregions produced enough wheat to satisfy the local populations’ food needs and excess grain to transport to other regions. Second, the SW and YV subregions produced wheat, but not enough to satisfy needs in these regions. Therefore, there was no excess grain to transport to other regions. Third, wheat was not planted in regions outside the study area, so wheat needs in them would have to be met by the grain trade. There was also spatial variation in per capita wheat production under the population and climate change scenarios. It increased in some areas, mainly in northern parts of the study region, and decreased in others, mainly in southern parts. The per capita wheat production decreased in most areas of GX and LP under
1 3
both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. It also decreased in the northern part of HH. However, projected per capita wheat production in most areas of SW and YV increased, indicating that climate and population change will influence the self-sufficiency of different regions and domestic food trade. Briefly, the supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas, i.e., the first type mentioned above, but increase in the second type. 5 conclusions Compared with wheat production in 2000–2010, wheat production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020–2030, 2030–2040 and 2040–2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. When considering population growth, the corresponding per capita potential production amounts did not significant differ (P > 0.05) from baseline levels. The projections indicate that the average per capita wheat production will decrease in the Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions, but increase in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys subregions. The results suggest that population growth will partly offset the benefits of climate change for the grain market, but there will be no food crisis due to climate change or population growth in China, although supply capacities of the main supply areas will decline.
