nanocellulose/alginate hydrogel composite beads for purifying mining effluents†
Dimitrios Georgouvelas,a Hani Nasser Abdelhamid, ab Ulrica Edlundc and Aji P. Mathew *a
Biobased adsorbents and membranes offer advantages related to resource efficiency, safety, and fast
kinetics but have challenges related to their reusability and water flux. Nanocellulose/alginate
composite hydrogel beads were successfully prepared with a diameter of about 3–4 mm and porosity
as high as 99%. The beads were further modified with in situ TEMPO-mediated oxidation to
functionalize the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and facilitate the removal of cationic pollutants from
aqueous samples at low pressure, driven by electrostatic interactions. The increased number of
carboxyl groups in the bead matrix improved the removal efficiency of the adsorbent without compromising the water throughput rate; being as high as 17 000 L h−1 m−2 bar−1. The absorptivity of
the beads was evaluated with UV-vis for the removal of the dye Methylene Blue (91% removal) from
spiked water and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elemental analyses for the removal of Cd2+ from industrial mining effluents. The modified beads
showed a 3-fold increase in ion adsorption and pose as excellent candidates for the manufacturing of
three-dimensional (3-D) column filters for large-volume, high flux water treatment under atmospheric
pressure. introduction Industrial wastewater treatment before its discharge is crucial to minimize the contamination of water streams with hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, for instance, heavy metal ions and dyes. Literature reports show the successful use of inorganic materials e.g., carbon, metal oxide, and their combinations produce adsorbents and membranes with catalytic properties or magnetic properties for the removal of metal ions and dyes.1–5
Cellulose and nanocellulose (either cellulose nanocrystals CNC or cellulose nanobril (CNF)) have emerged in recent years as versatile biobased choices for water treatment6–11 thanks to their meritorious properties, such as low environmental impact, high natural abundancy, and versatile surface chemistry which allows for functionalization.6,7 Cellulose offers an abundance of hydroxyl groups (–OH) which are susceptible to modication.

An efficient method to introduce carboxyl groups (–COO–) and increase the affinity of cellulose towards cationic species is by selectively oxidizing the primary alcohol of its structure via 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) mediated oxidation12 Currently, TEMPO oxidation constitutes the most used pretreatment method (before mechanical disintegration of cellulose pulps) for the preparation of highly charged CNF (oen denoted as TEMPO-CNF or TO-CNF) and has been reported as a successful in situ modication method of cellulosic membranes.13 Despite the broad use of cellulose membranes in water purication, there are certain limitations in their capabilities. The typically dense structure of the bodies of membranes leads to a high-pressure drop when used in dead-end ow and cross-ow. Pressure drop is dened as the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet of a lter and it can result in the movement or even fracture of the lter. One way to reduce the pressure drop is to increase the permeability of a membrane either by reducing its thickness or increasing its porosity. However, both approaches involve a tradeoff between the mechanical properties and the efficiency of the lter. A less dense membrane matrix entails that a smaller amount of material is used and fewer functional groups are present to facilitate the adsorption. To overcome these drawbacks, 3-D adsorbents have been developed, for instance in the form of spherically shaped and porous aerogel and hydrogel particles.14–17 Such particles were successfully prepared from

ce . several different hybrid materials, including graphene/ cellulose, poly(sodium acrylate)/cellulose, and starch mixtures, and proven efficient in water purication.18–20 The advantages of these adsorbents, oen denoted as aerogel or hydrogel beads, are that they offer a higher number of functional groups per area compared tomembranes, can be easily removed aer water treatment, and can be packed in cylindrical congurations for the manufacturing of lters that resemble the ion exchange resins and allow high water permeance. A facile method to prepare highly porous fully biobased beads is with the use of alginate/cellulose hydrogel composites.21–24 Alginate or alginic acid (commercially available as a sodium salt (SA)) is a linear polysaccharide extracted from brown algae.21 It consists of blocks of (1,4)-linked b-D-mannuronate (M) and a-L-guluronate (G) residues and as a copolymer, it is composed of either consecutive G or M units, for instance, GGGG or MMMM, or alternating M and G units, for instance, GMGMGM. Fig. 1 depicts the GGMMG conguration, as an example of an alginate structural motif. Due to its structure, alginate forms hydrogels upon interaction with ionic cross-linking agents such as divalent cations. When aqueous alginate solutions are poured dropwise into CaCl2 solutions they instantly form spherical-shaped hydrogels because of the ionic-crosslinking of the G units of adjacent polymer chains, forming a so-called egg-box structure.6 Notably, it is believed that only the G units bind to Ca2+ because of their higher degree of coordination.21
The carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of alginate and cellulose make cellulose/alginate composites highly promising for use in water treatment applications for the removal of cationic pollutants. Stand-alone alginate25,26 as well as cellulose/alginate beads27,28 have already been reported for heavy metal ion removal. We aimed to investigate the effect of in situ TEMPO oxidation on nanocellulose/alginate composite beads to control and enhance the performance which has not explored to date. We hypothesize that by oxidizing the available hydroxyl groups of cellulose, the amount of carboxyl groups would increase and thereby improve the removal capacity of the beads. For this purpose, commercial-grade debrillated cellulose and SA were used for the preparation of beads which were then modied in situ by TEMPO-mediated oxidation. The effect of this modication was monitored by comparing the adsorption capacity of the pristine hydrogel beads (denoted as C-SA) with that of TEMPO-oxidized beads (denoted as TO-C-SA) toward Methylene Blue (MB, a cationic model dye) and metal ion (Cd2+ from mining effluent), respectively. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry experimental  materials and methods Commercial grade debrillated cellulose with micro- and nanosized brils (Exilva, 10.1% (w/w)) was supplied by Borregaard AB (Sarpsborg, Norway). Alginic acid sodium salt (SA), calcium chloride, sodium bromide, cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate, ethanol (EtOH 95%), and Methylene Blue (MB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC, 20% in H2O) was used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid were purchased from VWR. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine1-oxyl (TEMPO) was purchased from TCI. All chemicals were used as received. Samples from Vormbäcken in Sweden, a water recipient of mining operation effluents, were kindly provided by Boliden. Composite hydrogel and beads preparation. SA (1 g) was vigorously mixed in 100 mL distilled H2O at 50 °C until a transparent solution was obtained. The SA solution was then mixed with a 1% (w/w) cellulose dispersion in a 1 : 1 ratio for 1 h. The mixture was then collected with a syringe and was poured dropwise into a CaCl2 (0.7 M) solution, through a 2 mm needle (Sterican, Braun) using a syringe pump at a rate of 0.5 mL min−1 (A video of the process is shown in the ESI,† S1). Despite their instantaneous formation, the beads were le in the CaCl2 solution for 30 more min for stabilization. Finally, the beads were collected, washed with H2O, and stored in H2O in the fridge. Before every use hereaer, unless otherwise noted, the beads were placed on dry paper for a few seconds to remove the excess absorbed water and have better control over their amount. In situ TEMPO oxidation of beads
TEMPO (0.03 g, 0.2 mM) was dispersed and 0.5 g NaBr (5 mM) was dissolved in 100 mL H2O. Then, 4.5 mL NaClO (aq) (10% v/ v, 6 mM) was added and the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 10 with dilute HCl (aq). Then, 10 g of partially dried hydrogel beads were added to the reaction mixture for 5 min. The beads were removed and transferred to an EtOH : H2O (1 : 4 ratio) mixture to quench the reaction for 1 min. Finally, the beads were washed with H2O and stored in H2O in the fridge until further use. Characterization of surface chemistry of the beads
Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of lyophilized beads were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1, through 64 scans, and a resolution of 4 cm−1 with an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (670-IR, Varian). All obtained spectra were baseline-corrected. Determination of surface charge density
Beads (1 g) were dispersed in 100 mL Milli-Q H2O. The mixture was vigorously mixed with UltraTurrax (IKA) at 15 000 rpm until a homogeneous dispersion was obtained. Aliquots (1 mL) of the dispersions (pristine and in situ oxidized beads, respectively)

Moreover, the morphology of the surface and the cross-section of lyophilized beads were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, TEM3000, Hitachi) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. porosity The porosity of the beads was calculated by the gravimetric method using eqn (2).23

Beads (1 g) were immersed in 100 mL dye solutions and aliquots were removed at specic times (aer 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, 300, and 720 min). The aliquots were then analyzed with UV-vis spectroscopy (Agilent Cary 5000 UV/vis/NIR, Agilent) in the spectral range 200–800 nm and the maximum absorbance at 665 nm (corresponding to MB) was recorded. determination of cd2+ removal Aqueous solutions of Cd2+ (400 mg L−1) were prepared. Beads (1 g) were immersed in 100 mL Cd2+ solutions and le for 1 h. The beads were then collected and dried at 40 °C under vacuum. Elemental analysis of the beads was performed with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an X-ray detector (TEM3000, Hitachi), at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. Similarly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of beads aer interaction with Cd2+ solution was performed via Thermo Fisher (K-Alpha) with micro-focused Al Ka radiation (energy of 1486.6 eV). A carbon peak at a binding energy of 284.2 eV was used as a reference. For these experiments, samples from effluents of a mining industry were used to study the selectivity of the beads towards Cd2+. 5894 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5892–5899 flux measurement The time needed for 100 mL H2O to pass through a chromatographic column with a beaded rim (Lenz, 30 mm diameter) was recorded. The measurement was repeated with the use of commercial lter paper (average pore size 6 mm, Munktell, Grade 3) and 1, 5, and 10 g of the beads. The reported values are averages of 5 replicates. results and discussion  surface chemistry of the beads Functional groups of the prepared beads before and aer the in situ modication were characterized with FT-IR (Fig. 2a). The recorded spectra show absorption peaks at 1606, 1420, and 1029 cm−1 which correspond to stretching vibrations of – – COO− (asymmetric), –COO− (symmetric), and C–O bonds, respectively.24 The increase in the intensity of the peaks of TO-CSA compared to C-SA is attributed to the increase of carboxyl groups aer oxidation. The increase in the number of carboxyl groups in the composition of the beads aer oxidation is also supported by an increase in surface charge density from 291 ± 51 mmol kg−1 for the C-SA to 477 ± 47 mmol kg−1 for TO-C-SA. An earlier report from our group on in situ TEMPO oxidation of cellulose membranes (sludge-CNF/CNCBE membranes, “BE” herein stands for “bioethanol” because this CNC was produced from the residue of bioethanol production), showed an increase in acidic group content from∼7 to∼42mmol kg−1, corresponding to a signicant 6-fold charge increase.13 In the current case, the charge density of the beads aer modication is signicantly higher (almost 10 times), however, the increase between modied and unmodied beads showed only a two-fold increase which can be attributed to the abundance of carboxyl groups in the alginate phase used for beads processing.

From the obtained micrographs, there is no signicant change in the morphology of the beads aer in situ oxidation. The average dry weight of the TO-C-SA beads was about half of the C-SA beads while their average wet weight was almost identical. This is probably attributable to the fact that the modied beads are more hydrophilic and, therefore, absorb more H2O.12 TO-C-SA contains more carboxyl groups than C-SA, explaining the difference in hydrophilicity. Nevertheless, the differences in average dry and wet weights did not signicantly affect the porosity of the beads before and aer the modication (Table 1). mb removal The effect of the modication on the adsorptivity of the beads toward cationic dyes was monitored with MB, which is positively charged at neutral pH.29 The obtained data from UV-vis measurements showed that the pristine beads have an adequate removal efficiency of 75% aer 12 h (for initial MB concentration). In situ oxidation of the beads increased the total MB removal efficiency, reaching 91% aer 12 h (Fig. 4). Adsorption of positively charged dyes shows a systematic increase with carboxyl group content indicating that the

A summary of beads used for dye adsorption is tabulated in Table 2. Chitosan (CTS) beads with montmorillonite (MT) were investigated for methyl green (MG) adsorption from aqueous solutions.30 Aer optimizing many parameters, the beads offered efficiency of 99%. Alginate beads containing polyamidoamine/halloysite nanotubes (Alg/Hal_PAMAM beads) was also reported for MG adsorption.31 These composite beads exhibit good adsorption efficiencies. However, it contains inorganic clays e.g. montmorillonite or halloysite that can be a source of contamination for long-term exposure. Our beads are pure organic biopolymers without any inorganic materials with good efficiency. It should be also notted that most of these efficiencies are based on the biopolymer of the beads e.g., chitosan.31 Cellulose-based beads are economically cheaper than chitosan based beads.32 Copper ions were suggested to replace Ca2+ for the formation of Graphene oxide (GO)/SA/Carrageenan (GO/Alg-Car) beads (Ala : Car : GO = 2 : 2 : 1).33 The use of Ca2+ is environmentally benign compared to Cu2+ ions that can be released into the aqueoutic system causing secondary pollution. SA beads of meso-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrinto) zinc(II) complex (Zn(TMP)) containing 3% of SA was reported for MB adsorption.34 TO-C-SA beads exhibit comparable adsorption efficiency with a suitable equilibrium time to reach the steady state (Table 2). cd2+ removal The adsorption capacity of the prepared beads towards Cd2+ was studied with EDS and XPS elemental analyses. For the former, spiked Cd2+ aqueous samples were used while for the latter, samples from a water recipient of mining discharge were used in an attempt to monitor the selectivity of the beads towards Cd2+. EDS elemental analysis of the beads aer immersion in aqueous Cd2+ samples showed an increase in Cd2+ atomic percentage (at%) from 2.53 to 6.98 (Table 3). Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5892–5899 | 5895

ce . This almost 3-fold increase in Cd2+ atomic percentage can be attributed to the carboxyl groups generated in the in situ oxidation of the beads. In addition, an increase in the atomic percentage of Ca2+ can be observed. The at% of adsorbed Cd2+ on the surface of the beads was estimated from the XPS elemental survey. The data indicate an improvement in ion adsorption; the at% of Cd2+ increased from 0.84 for the pristine beads to 1.76 for the modied ones (Fig. 5). This again supports the concept of ion adsorption driven by electrostatic interactions. Sehaqui et al.35 studied the adsorption of divalent metal e.g., Cu2+ onto oxidized cellulose and showed that the adsorption increases inearly with carboxylate content with maximum adsorption capacities of 55 mg g−1 at neutral pH. It was established that Cu2+ ions are adsorbed onto the TCNF via electrostatic interactions involving the carboxyl groups on the oxidized cellulose ber surface.36 The proton of the carboxyl group is exchanged with a metal ion during the adsorption process. Although the obtained data from EDS and XPS follow the same trend, there are signicant differences in at% values. XPS is a surface analysis technique using a lower energy X-ray beam compared to EDS. In XPS, the beam penetration depth is about 10 nm while EDS assesses the entire bulk. In addition, the XPS measurements were performed on beads that were used to treat samples of actual effluents from mining. The presence of a plethora of charged contaminants may have affected the interaction between the beads and Cd2+. ads after Cd2+ adsorption. © 2023 The Author(s).

The deconvolution of the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of CSA beads aer Cd2+ adsorption reveals distinct peaks at binding energies (BE) of 284.4, 286.6, 287.2, and 288.2 eV which correspond to C–C, C–O, C]O, and O–C]O, respectively (Fig. 6a). Similarly, the deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum of TO-C-SA beads aer adsorption shows peaks at BE of 284.8, 286.7, 288.2, 288.9, and 289.4 eV (Fig. 6b). The rst three peaks are assigned to C–C, C–O, and C]O, respectively. The peaks at 288.9 and 289.4 eV correspond to the carboxyl groups (O–C]O) for alginate (G or M) and TEMPO-oxidized cellulose (O–C]O), respectively.37
The deconvolution of the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of C-SA beads aer Cd2+ adsorption reveals peaks at BE of 530.9, 531.9, 532.9, and 533.9 eV, which correspond to C–O, C]O, O– C]O, and O–Cd, respectively (Fig. 7a). From the deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum of TO-C-SA beads aer adsorption, peaks at BE of 530.4, 531.4, 532.5, and 533.9 eV are revealed (Fig. 7b). The peaks correspond to the same type of O as in C-SA; however, the intensity of the peak that corresponds to C]O increases, presumably due to the contribution of the carboxyl O atoms that are introduced with the TEMPO oxidation.38,39

Finally, the deconvolution of the high-resolution spectrum of Cd 3d2 of C-SA beads aer Cd2+ adsorption reveals two distinct peaks at BE of 405.5 and 412.3 eV, corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 types of Cd, respectively (Fig. 8a). Cd
2+ is adsorbed on the surface of the beads due to interactions with the O atoms of the carbonyl groups of alginate. However, the deconvolution of the Cd 3d2 spectrum of the TO-C-SA beads reveals two additional lower-intensity peaks at 404.8 and 413.2 eV (Fig. 8b). These two peaks presumably correspond to Cd2+ ions that are adsorbed on the surface of the beads due to interactions with the carboxyl O atoms that are introduced with the TEMPO oxidation. Binding energies of approximately 7 eV of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 are characteristic of the two states of Cd2+.8 loose-ll column lters To evaluate the potential to use the beads in column lters and to compare the effect on water ux, the required time for 100 mL H2O to pass through a chromatographic column with a beaded rim under the effect of atmospheric pressure was measured.

ce . of any adsorbent was measured to be 28.7± 2.3 s (ux 177 371 L h−1 m−2 bar−1). The dewatering time increased to 46.3 ± 2.6 s with the use of commercial-grade lter paper. The required dewatering time was 28.8 ± 2.2, 30.5 ± 3.1, and 44.2 ± 3.6 s when packing the column with 1, 5, and 10 g of C-SA beads, respectively (the corresponding ux was calculated to be 16 720, 17 724, 11 541 L h−1 m−2 bar−1) The required dewatering time was identical when instead lling the column with TO-C-SA beads was 28.6 ± 1.1, 30.4 ± 0.7, and 44.0 ± 2.5 s for 1, 5, and 10 g of beads, respectively (the experimental set up is shown in Fig. 9). The obtained dewatering times clearly show that a single layer of beads with 1 g of beads did not affect the water ow. An amount of 10 g of beads, which formed a stack of layers of approximately 2.5 cm, showed better water ux than commercial lter paper. Additionally, the average dewatering times for TO-C-SA and C-SA beads are the same which indicates that, in this range, the functionalization does not affect the water ux. Furthermore, the water ux was found to be higher than that reported for cellulose-based layered membrane systems in previous studies from our group which uctuated from 3417 to 14 742 L h−1 m−2 bar−1.13,40–43 conclusions We devised a facile method of preparing nanocellulose/alginate composite beads with increased adsorption performance derived from the in situ TEMPO oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Oxidation of the beads increased the number of carboxyl groups which can facilitate the removal of cationic impurities from aqueous samples. The enhancement of removal efficiency of the cationic dye MB and Cd2+ was conrmed with UV-vis measurements (for MB), EDS, and XPS

(for Cd2+). Interestingly, the EDS elemental analysis of the beads showed an almost 3-fold improvement in Cd2+ removal aer the in situ oxidation. Furthermore, the obtained water ux data indicates that the prepared beads can be used for the manufacturing of column lters. This approach offers lters with a higher amount of adsorbent and better water permeability than 2D membrane lters. Overall, the abundance of the component feedstock, as well as the ease and efficiency of the modication route indicate that the nanocomposite beads are promising candidates for larger production and manufacturing of column lters for water purication.
