A new heteronuclear decoupling sequence for solid-state NMR and magic angle spinning faster than 60 kHz was recently introduced [Simion et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 014202 (2022)]. It was dubbed ROtor-Synchronized Phase-Alternated Cycles (ROSPAC), and it offers robustness for a large range of chemical shifts and low radio-frequency (RF) powers and is almost independent of the radio-frequency power. Here, we theoretically explore the robustness of the ROSPAC sequence toward H offset and RF field inhomogeneities, as well as the spacing effect of the π pulses on the decoupling efficiency. We use a generalized theoretical framework based on the Floquet theory to assess these parameters. The optimum decoupling conditions, where the magnitude of the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions are small, were identified. © 2023 Author(s).

(1) into an interaction frame with the radio-frequency Hamiltonian. The most general case is off-resonance irradiation of the spins where we use the combined offset and rf-field Hamiltonian for the interaction-frame transformation:
ˆ̃H(t) = Û1(t)Ĥ(t)Û−11 (t), (3)

The spin operators in the interaction frame can be represented as a linear combination of the three Cartesian spin operators in the laboratory frame with time-dependent coefficients:33
ˆ̃Iz(t) = ax(t)Îx + ay(t)Îy + az(t)Îz , (5)
where the time-dependent coefficients aχ(t), with χ = x, y, and z represent the spin-trajectory coefficients under the interaction-frame transformation. In general, they can be expressed as a Fourier series with the two frequencies ωm and ωeff as33
aχ(t) = ∞ ∑

∑ l=−1
a(k,l)χ e ikωmteilωefft , (6)
where k and l are integer numbers, and a(k,l)χ are the Fourier coefficient characterizing the interaction-frame trajectory of the ˆ̃Iz(t) operator. b. effective hamiltonian and second-order cross-terms In the general case, the time-dependent interaction-frame Hamiltonian ˆ̃H(t) is, therefore, modulated by three basic frequencies, namely the MAS frequency ωr, the modulation frequency ωm = 2π/(16nτr) (see. Fig. 1), and the effective nutation frequency ωeff, and is given by
ˆ̃H(t) = 2
∑ n=−2
∞ ∑
k=−∞
2
∑ l=−2
ˆ̃H (n,k,l)einωrteikωmteilωefft , (7)
where ˆ̃H (n,k,l) are the Fourier coefficients of the time-dependent interaction-frame Hamiltonian. To characterize decoupling, the residual couplings under decoupling are the most important terms that are contained in the non-resonant part of the effective Hamiltonian. The non-resonant part of the effective Hamiltonian is given by
ˆ̃H = ˆ̃H (1) + ˆ̃H (2) + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = ˆ̃H (0,0,0) + ˆ̃H(0,0,0)(2) + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅
= ˆ̃H (0,0,0) − 1 2∑ν,k,λ [ ˆ̃H (−ν,−k,−λ), ˆ̃H (ν,k,λ)] νωr + κωm + λωeff . (8)
The first-order contribution would only contain the homonuclear J couplings of the protons for on-resonance irradiation and, in addition, scaled heteronuclear J couplings and chemical shifts of the protons for off-resonance irradiation. Those terms will be neglected in the discussion since they are typically quite small. The second-order term determines the performance of the decoupling sequences, being directly responsible for the main contribution to the residual linewidth. One can decompose this non-resonant second-order term into six contributions,32
ˆ̃H (2) = −1 2∑ν,k,λ [ ˆ̃H (−ν,−κ,−λ), ˆ̃H (ν,κ,λ)] νωr + κωm + λωeff
= ˆ̃HIS⊗I + ˆ̃HIS⊗II + ˆ̃HI⊗II + ˆ̃HII⊗II + ˆ̃HI⊗I + ˆ̃HIS⊗IS, (9)
where ˆ̃HIS⊗I is the cross-term between the heteronuclear dipolar coupling and the I-spin CSA tensor and ˆ̃HIS⊗II represent the crossterm between the heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings. These two terms directly influence the residual coupling under the decoupling sequence. The next two terms, ˆ̃HI⊗II and ˆ̃HII⊗II , represent the cross-term between CSA tensor and homonuclear coupling, and the cross-term between homonuclear couplings of I-spins, respectively, and can have an effect on the I-spins diffusion, depending on the spinning frequency. The last two terms, ˆ̃HI⊗I and ˆ̃HIS⊗IS, are cross terms between CSA and heteronuclear dipolar couplings, respectively, generating only fictitious fields that do not influence directly the residual line broadening but could have truncation effects in the Hamiltonian. The first two second-order terms are given by32

Here, εχi j is the Levi-Cività symbol and a(κ,λ)μχ are the Fourier coefficients for the rank-two spin tensor defined as a convolution of the rank-one Fourier coefficients a(κ,λ)χ [Eq. (6)] obtained from the interaction-frame trajectory.32 Note that the two expressions in Eq. (12) are similar, except for the Fourier coefficients in the numerator, i.e., the former has a rank-one spin tensor (a(κ,λ)i ), whereas the later has a rank-two spin tensor (a(κ,λ)χi ). The two terms from the second-order non-resonant effective Hamiltonian [Eqs. (10) and (11)] lead to a direct residual line broadening of the S-spin. Their effect will be further analyzed for on-resonant and off-resonant irradiation. For this purpose, two scaling factors based on Eq. (12) will be calculated for ν = 1 and ν = 2 (q(ν)IS⊗I = √ ∑χ (q (ν) χ )2 and q(ν)IS⊗II = √ ∑χ,μ (q (ν) χ,μ )2), taking into account that for the ROSPAC sequence ωeff = 0 for on-resonant irradiation (and ωeff ≠ 0 otherwise). Note that for off-resonance irradiation the offset added to the RF Hamiltonian changes only the effective nutation frequency ωeff(ΔΩ) and the Fourier coefficients a(k,l)χ as a function of offset, but the general equations obtained for the effective Hamiltonians [Eqs. (10) and (11)], and the scaling factors [Eq. (12)] are unchanged. The modulation frequency ωm of the sequence is unchanged because the timing is unchanged. J. Chem.

12 January 2024 18:30:01 c. first-order resonance conditions We also analyze possible resonance conditions, since they could recouple different interactions that possibly lead to a line broadening. A first type of resonance condition is given by n0ωr + k0ωm = 0 since the sequence is always rotor synchronized. The modulation frequency ωm = 2π/τm is given by the number of rotor periods that the sequence spans as ωm = ωr/(16n) or τm = 16nτr (see Fig. 1). The strength of the resonance condition is directly given by the Fourier coefficients a(16n,0)χ . As a measure for the strength of the resonance condition, we use the a(k0 ,0) = √ ∑χ (a (k0 ,0) χ )2 parameter. Two other types of possible resonance conditions are k0ωm + l0ωeff = 0 and n0ωr + k0ωm + l0ωeff = 0, but these are not of interest here because the former one can only be fulfilled for terms that are not modulated by MAS (i.e., n0 = 0), meaning that only isotropic interactions could contribute to such a resonance condition, whereas the latter is never fulfilled because ωeff is always smaller than 12 ωm and ωr is an integer multiple of ωm. In the case of very small values of ωeff, nearresonance conditions could become important, but they are difficult to describe by Floquet theory. iii. materials and methods The calculation of the interaction-frame trajectory, the Fourier coefficients, the cross-terms between the heteronuclear dipolar coupling and the I-spin CSA tensor and between the heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings, as well as the first-order resonance conditions, was done using the software package Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.). First, the interaction-frame trajectory under the ROSPAC sequence was obtained for the ˆ̃Iz operator at a given MAS frequency and different RF powers (supplementary material, Fig. S1). The spacing of the π pulses was set to 6τr for νr = 100 kHz, 4τr for νr = 60 kHz, and τr for νr = 40 kHz, unless mentioned otherwise. Only the zcomponent of the I spin was considered because the Hamiltonian contains just z-components. Second, the Fourier coefficients a(k,l)χ characterizing the interaction frame trajectories from Fig. S1 were obtained by a Fourier transform of the interaction-frame trajectory (supplementary material, Fig. S2). For low-power decoupling, i.e., 20 kHz, the number of the Fourier coefficients that have a contribution to the effective Hamiltonian correspond to low k-orders, i.e., for k > 50, they are small and were neglected. For intermediate-power or high-power decoupling, i.e., 70 and 160 kHz, respectively, the

magnitude of high k-orders increased and was considered, up to k = 200. Experimental measurements were performed on a sample of labeled 13C2–15N-glycine ethyl ester, using a Bruker 0.7 mm tripleresonance MAS probe on a Bruker Avance-III 850 MHz spectrometer. A spinning frequency of 100 kHz was used in all experiments with a stability of about ±10 Hz. 13C MAS NMR spectra were acquired using cross-polarization from protons with a linear ramp. The contact time was 1 ms with rf-field amplitudes of 70 and 30 kHz on 1H and 13C, respectively. For each spectrum, 16 scans with 2048 complex data points were acquired with a spectral width of 50 kHz and a recycle delay of 3 s. For decoupling using the ROSPAC sequence, a pulse with a flip angle β was applied every six rotor cycles without any active synchronization of the MAS frequency. The rffield amplitude of the decoupling pulse was set to 20, 40, 80, and 160 kHz, respectively, using a simple 180○ pulse to determine the power levels. iv. results and discussion The theoretical results are divided into two main parts: (i) robustness toward 1H offset and (ii) dependence of the decoupling performance on the flip angle. The former determines the quality of the decoupling under realistic conditions (e.g., a distribution of chemical-shift values of the protons), whereas the latter is related to the stability of the sequence and ease of setup (e.g., inhomogeneous RF fields and missetting of the rf-field amplitude). a. robustness toward 1h offset  1. 1h offset dependence on the spinning frequency and rf amplitude The dependence of the decoupling efficiency on the chemical shift offset is one of the most important criteria for decoupling sequences. In liquid-state NMR, very good offset compensation at

the lowest possible field is one of the design features of the most commonly used decoupling sequences. In solid-state NMR, highpower decoupling sequences (i.e., ω1 > 3ωr) are usually inherently broadband enough since nutation frequency of the rf-field is about an order of magnitude larger than the chemical-shift range for protons. For low-power decoupling (i.e., ω1 < 13 ωr), however, the nutation frequency of the decoupling field is significantly smaller than the MAS frequency and is often in the same order of magnitude as the chemical-shift range of protons. Therefore, the chemicalshift offset dependence becomes an important parameter for these sequences. Figure 2 shows the logarithm of the magnitude of the scaling factors [log10(q (ν) IS⊗I) and log10(q (ν) IS⊗II)] for the second-order cross terms as a function of the RF amplitude (ν1) and 1H offset frequency (ΔΩ), for three MAS frequencies: 100, 60, and 40 kHz. One can observe that the ν = 1 cross term has a slightly higher contribution to the effective Hamiltonian than the ν = 2 cross terms, due to their scaling with ωr and 2ωr, respectively. Moreover, the dipole-dipole cross terms are as expected, zero for on-resonance irradiation, but are increasing in the off-resonant case. One can clearly see that the offset dependence of the second-order cross terms improves with increasing spinning frequency and also increasing rf-field amplitude. However, all of the second-order cross-terms have a relatively small magnitude, independent of the radio frequency power or the 1H offset, and therefore, we expect reasonable decoupling for the whole parameter range. The magnitude of the Fourier coefficients a(k0 ,0)χ at the resonance conditions n0ωr + k0ωm = 0 determine the scaling of the resonant part of the Hamiltonian that directly reintroduces part of the heteronuclear dipolar coupling. Their magnitude for a certain k0 value changes with the 1H offset and RF field amplitude because of the changes in the interaction-frame trajectory. Figure 3
shows the logarithm of the magnitude of the resonant Fourier coefficients log10(a
(n016n,0)) for n0 = 1 and n0 = 2 as a function of the RF field amplitude (ν1) and offset frequency (ΔΩ) for the three MAS frequencies 100, 60, and 40 kHz, respectively. In all cases, the resonant contributions are minimal on-resonance and increase with increasing resonance offset. With increasing rf-field amplitude, offset effects become smaller. For lower MAS frequency, the value of k0 = n016n at the resonance condition is smaller due to the choice of the spacing of the pulses (smaller value of n) and the values of log10(a
(k0 ,0)) get larger. For 100 kHz MAS, the magnitude of the Fourier component
at the resonance conditions increases for higher values of the RF field, the enhancement in magnitude being faster for n0 = 1 than for n0 = 2. For on-resonant irradiation, i.e., ΔΩ = 0, the line broadening by the resonance conditions is negligible, whereas for off-resonance irradiation, there is a significant influence on the decoupling efficiency, especially in the high-power irradiation regime. One can see that in the low-power decoupling regime, the magnitude of the resonant contribution to the linewidth is quite small even for off-resonance irradiation, suggesting a better robustness toward 1H offset under low-power irradiation than in the case of high-power irradiation. If the spinning frequency is decreased, lower values of k0 determine the Fourier coefficients at the resonance conditions. The magnitude of the resonance conditions becomes quite large (except on resonance), and therefore, the decoupling will be worse at lower MAS frequencies. In conclusion, the main contribution to the line broadening as a function of 1H offset is from the first-order resonance conditions and not the second-order cross terms. The amplitude of the resonance conditions is especially high in the high-power irradiation regime or for low spinning frequencies. Therefore, robustness regarding 1H offset is expected in the low-power irradiation regime under fast MAS. FIG. 5.

Although the numerical values of the second-order scaling factors [log10(q (ν) IS⊗I) and log10(q (ν) IS⊗II) in Fig. 2] and the Fourier coefficients at the resonance conditions [log10(a (n016n,0)) in Fig. 3] might seem small, they give rise to a significant residual coupling. Especially the resonant terms generate directly a dipolar coupling scaled by the Fourier coefficient. Even Fourier coefficients as small as 10−3 and below will lead to a significant broadening of the line due to the large values of the one-bond couplings. The same is true for the second-order cross terms between homonuclear and heteronuclear couplings that can both have anisotropies in the order of 45–50 kHz. 2. 1h offset dependence as a function of the π-pulse spacing Depending on the spacing of the π-pulses (i.e., nτr, where τr is the rotor period), the modulation frequency has different values and, therefore, will modify the magnitude of the second-order crossterms and first-order resonance conditions. In our previous work,25 it was demonstrated experimentally that n should have different values, depending on the MAS frequency, to obtain a decoupling sequence that is almost independent of the RF power. It was found that good choices are n = 6 for νr = 100 kHz, n = 4 for νr = 60 kHz, and n = 2 for νr = 40 kHz, respectively. Here, the effect of the delay

between the π-pulses on the robustness toward 1H offset is analyzed for the following three spinning frequencies: 100, 60, and 40 kHz, respectively. Figure 4 shows the magnitude of the second-order cross-terms as a function of the RF power and 1H offset for a rotation frequency of 100 kHz and different delays between the π-pulses. The results obtained for 60 and 40 kHz MAS are presented in the supplementary material (Fig. S3). It was found that the larger the delay between the π-pulses, the smaller the magnitude of the second-order cross-terms, whatever the rotation frequency. This case of large delays corresponds to a pulsed decoupling regime, where the spacing between the pulses is at least twice the pulse length. This is not surprising since second-order cross-terms between the CSA and the heteronuclear dipolar coupling would be zero without RF irradiation and only
cross-terms between the homonuclear and heteronuclear dipolar coupling would exist. The magnitude of the first-order resonance conditions as a function of the RF power and 1H offset for 100 kHz MAS and different delays between the π-pulses are shown in Fig. 5, whereas the results for 60 kHz MAS and 40 kHz MAS can be found in the supplementary material (Fig. S4). Increasing the delay between the π-pulses, the magnitude of the first-order resonance conditions becomes smaller, especially for low RF fields. This is not surprising since higher Fourier coefficients are important at the resonance conditions that are typically decreasing in magnitude. One can see that for 100 kHz MAS and a radio-frequency field of 20 kHz, the resonance conditions for both n0 = 1 and n0 = 2 are small, enabling to obtain robustness toward 1H offset, whatever is the delay between

the π-pulses. For lower spinning frequency, it is not possible to avoid simultaneously the two resonance conditions (n0 = 1 and n0 = 2), whatever the RF power. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve robustness toward 1H offset. These results demonstrate that robustness toward 1H offset can be obtained for fast spinning frequencies (e.g., 100 kHz) and low radio-frequency irradiation. Increasing the delay between the π-pulses has no significant effect on the 1H offset since magnitude of the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions exhibit a small modification in their magnitude. Therefore, one can use the ROSPAC decoupling sequence in the intermediate decoupling regime, where the delay between the π-pulses is closer to the π-pulse lengths (e.g., 6τr for 100 kHz MAS). In that case, one achieves good robustness toward 1H offset and one obtains a decoupling that is almost independent of the RF power. b. flip-angle dependence The RF field over the full volume of a rotor that is generated in a solenoid coil is inhomogeneous over the sample volume, and in addition, MAS modulates the rf-field amplitude. A spin system travels through areas of different RF amplitudes, and the modulation becomes particularly severe at the end regions of the coil where the relative RF amplitude varies up to 25%.34 Static and MASmodulated RF-field inhomogeneities affect the signal intensity in the NMR spectra. Thus, the design of heteronuclear decoupling pulse sequences that are robust toward RF-field inhomogeneities is of great interest. In this subsection, we demonstrated the influence of
the flip angle on the decoupling performance to illustrate robustness toward RF field inhomogeneities. Figure 6 shows the logarithm of the magnitude of the scaling factors [log10(q (ν) IS⊗I) and log10(q (ν) IS⊗II)] as a function of the RF pulse flip angle, for a rotation frequency of 100 kHz, in three decoupling regimes: low-power, intermediate-power, and high-power. The second-order cross terms between heteronuclear dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy are slightly affected by radiofrequency field inhomogeneities, especially in the low-power decoupling regime, where the CSA and RF terms have the same order of magnitude. However, one can see that choosing a flip angle in the range of 160○–170○ or 190○–200○ enables us to minimize variations due to the RF field inhomogeneities. The second-order cross-terms between heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings present resonance conditions outside the previously mentioned intervals (e.g., for a flip angle of 180○), but their magnitude remains small whatever the variation of the magnetic field. The scaling factors were also calculated for 60 and 40 kHz spinning frequencies, and are reported in the supplementary material (Fig. S5). Decreasing the spinning frequency, the magnitude of the second-order crossterms between heteronuclear dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy becomes slightly higher, but the decoupling is still robust toward RF field inhomogeneities for the same ranges of the flip angle as in the case of 100 kHz MAS. The first-order resonance conditions as a function of the RF pulse flip angle were also evaluated, for three rotation frequencies: 100 kHz (Fig. 7), 60, and 40 kHz, respectively (supplementary material, Fig. S6). They have the same behavior as the second-order

cross-terms between heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings and, therefore, have no influence on the robustness toward RF field inhomogeneities. These calculations demonstrate that for a flip angle in the range of 160○–200○, the influence of the RF field inhomogeneity (or missettings of the flip angle) can be minimized. This result is in agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 8) that show also a plateau of good decoupling in the range of roughly 160○–200○. Moreover, it was observed experimentally that changing the delay between the π−pulses does not have a strong influence on the robustness toward RF field amplitude changes. These results confirm the ease of setup of the ROSPAC heteronuclear decoupling sequence. v. conclusions In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of ROSPAC heteronuclear decoupling sequence in different regimes from lowpower to high-power RF irradiation and under intermediate to fast MAS. The optimum decoupling conditions were found for lowpower irradiation and fast spinning frequency. In this case, the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions are small, and therefore, one obtains robustness toward 1H offset and radio-frequency field inhomogeneities.
