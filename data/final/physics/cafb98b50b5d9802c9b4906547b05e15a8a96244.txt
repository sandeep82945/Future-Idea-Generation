Plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted great attention in the field of catalysis and sensing for their outstanding electrical and optical properties. Here, a representative type of nonstoichiometric Cu2−xSe nanoparticles with typical near-infrared (NIR) localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) properties originating from their copper deficiency was applied to catalyze the oxidation of colorless TMB into their blue product in the presence of H2O2, indicating they had good peroxidase-like activity. However, glutathione (GSH) inhibited the catalytic oxidation of TMB, as it can consume the reactive oxygen species. Meanwhile, it can induce the reduction of Cu(II) in Cu2−xSe, resulting in a decrease in the degree of copper deficiency, which can lead to a reduction in the LSPR. Therefore, the catalytic ability and photothermal responses of Cu2−xSe were decreased. Thus, in our work, a colorimetric/photothermal dual-readout array was developed for the detection of GSH. The linear calibration for GSH concentration was in the range of 1–50 μM with the LOD as 0.13 μM and 50–800 μM with the LOD as 39.27 μM. To evaluate the practicability of the assay, tomatoes and cucumbers were selected as real samples, and good recoveries indicated that the developed assay had great potential in real applications. 1. introduction Doped semiconductor nanocrystals with a dynamic manipulation of carrier densities have attracted great attention in the field of sensing, catalysis and photonics technologies [1–3]. They show plasmonic optical responses similar to the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) of noble metals, such as Ag and Au nanomaterials [4,5]. However, their plasmonic spectroscopic signature tuning can be achieved by modulating their doping which is not easily realized by metal nanoparticles [6]. Recently, research has been focused on semiconductor nanocrystals based on earth-abundant transition metals such as copper for their low cost [7,8]. Nonstoichiometric copper selenide nanoparticles (Cu2−xSe) are a typical self-doped representative with a high carrier (holes) concentration leading to the evolution of NIR LSPR [9,10]. The Cu(I)/Cu(II) always coexists in these nanocrystals (NCs), acting as a source of optically active holes, and the optical properties can be adjusted effectively by the Cu-defect, exhibiting a blueshift or redshift in the absorption spectrum located in the NIR [11,12]. Many reports have shown that their LSPR tunability in a broad wavelength range can be controlled either by developing synthesis strategies or performing red–ox reactions in the post-synthesis [13–16]. It has been proved that the stoichiometric form Cu2Se does not provide plasmon resonances, while its nonstoichiometric composition Cu2−xSe induced a localized surface plasmon extinction band in the NIR for the introduction of Cu(II) [17,18]. This phenomenon was confirmed by Dorfs et al., who showed that the addition of an excess of Cu+ ions could result in a reduction in the NIR LSPR band, but

the addition of an oxidizer Ce(IV) could enhance the plasmon band due to the increase in copper vacancies [19]. It is worth mentioning that high copper vacancies can make Cu2−xSe good electron donors and acceptors; thus, they have the good catalytic ability by facilitating electron transfer [20,21]. Our group demonstrated that copper vacancies acted as reactive sites for the enhancement of chemiluminescence (CL) in the luminol–H2O2 system [22]. Furthermore, the coexistence of Cu(I)/Cu(II) in the Cu2−xSe nanocrystals was similar to the Fenton reagent [23–27]. Thus, they were proved to exhibit a peroxidase-like activity which could accelerate the oxidation of colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to its blue product (oxidized TMB, OxTMB) with H2O2. Based on the catalytic activity of Cu2−xSe, some colorimetric assays for measuring various targets have been developed [28–30]. Compared with photoluminescence, photothermal responses mainly result from local temperature changes, which lead to a high sensitivity because of the low background noise [31,32]. Hessel et al. proved that Cu2−xSe nanocrystals exhibited an intense NIR absorbance peak and exhibited marked photoinduced heating as Au nanorods and Au nanoshells excited by a NIR laser [33]. Due to the high and stable photothermal conversion, low toxicity, and easy preparation, Cu2−xSe nanomaterials have been used as promising photothermal agents in photothermal therapy and sensing [34–39]. The adjustability of the photothermal efficiency due to their dynamic LSPR properties made a photothermal signal of Cu2−xSe nanomaterials available for qualitative analysis [40]. Glutathione (GSH), as a typical biological thiol, performs many physiological functions in the biological systems [41–43]. However, they can be oxidized to GSSG by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced by aging or diseases [44,45]. Thus, GSH is commonly used in various medicinal and functional foods to serve as an anti-aging and immunityenhancing component [46]. However, an overdose of GSH can result in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, liver damage and cancer et al. [47]. It strongly suggests that a GSH balance should be maintained. Therefore, an accurate GSH quantification in medicine and foods is essential to provide a reference for the daily GSH supplement for disease prevention and treatment. Currently, the reported assays for GSH include fluorescence [48], colorimetric [49], electrochemiluminescence [50], etc. To meet the growing demand for sensing technology, the integration of two sensing signals in dual-mode sensing technology not only reduces assumptions but also increases the linear range of detection and application flexibility [51]. Based on the above consideration, the Cu2−xSe nanoparticles in which Cu(I)/Cu(II) coexisted, acting as a source of optically active holes, were used to catalyze the oxidation of colorless TMB into its blue product in the presence of H2O2. In the catalytic process, the Cu2−xSe nanoparticles showed peroxidase-like activity. In the presence of GSH, the peroxidase-like activity of Cu2−xSe was inhibited, and its NIR LSPR was decreased. Thus, a colorimetric/photothermal dualreadout array based on the copper deficiency modulation of Cu2−xSe was developed for the detection of GSH (Scheme 1).

(Shanghai, China). L-Glutathione reduced (GSH) were obtained from SigmaAldrich (Shanghai, China). Copper sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) and GSH array kits were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ascorbic acid (Vc) and H2O2 were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd., (Chengdu, China). The absorption of samples was acquired by a UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyzer (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyzer (F200X, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) was used for the nanoprobe morphological characterization. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) was used for ·OH determination (A300-10/12, Bruker, Bremen, Germany). 2.2. synthesis of cu2−xse nps The Cu2−xSe NPs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method [22]. In total, 0.8 mL 5 mg/mL PSS, 0.2 mL 0.05 M SeO2 and 15 mg/mL Vc were mixed with 5.6 mL H2O in a round-bottom flask for 10 min at 30 ◦C. A mixture of 0.4 mL 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O and 0.8 mL 15 mg/mL Vc was added and stirred for 30 min, then, the temperature was raised to 45 ◦C and continued to be stirred at room temperature for 10 h until a green solution was obtained. The resulting mixture was allowed to react under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 10 h until a green solution was obtained and purified through a 10 kDa dialysis membrane for 1 day with 6 changes in the distilled water. After the dialysis, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended with an equal volume of water [22]. 2.3. analytical process for gsh detection A total of 25 µg/mLCu2−xSe 7.5 mM H2O2, 1.5 mM TMB and different concentrations of GSH (0–800 µM) were added to the PBS solution with pH6.5, which reacted at room temperature for 30 min for subsequent detection. For the colorimetric detection, its absorbance value at the characteristic absorption peak of OxTMB (650 nm) was recorded (A or A0). The ∆A = A0 − A was calculated, and the GSH concentration was quantitatively analyzed according to the ∆A/A0. For the photothermal detection, all solutions were exposed to a 1064 nm laser (1.0 W/cm2, 5 min), and the temperature and photothermal images were recorded by a thermometer and infrared thermal imager. 2.4. gsh detection in real samples Tomatoes and cucumbers were selected as real samples to evaluate the practicability of the array by the standard recovery method. The tomatoes and cucumbers were washed with pure water and dried naturally. Then, they were crushed with a juicer and centrifuged 3–4 times (10,000 rpm, 5 min), while the upper supernatant was filtered with a 0.22 µm filter membrane for further detection. Briefly, 100 µL of the diluted samples and certain concentrations of GSH (30.0 µM) were added to the above detection system (25 µg/mLCu2−xSe, 7.5 mM H2O2, 1.5 Mm TMB, pH 6.5) and reacted for 30 min. The absorbance value at the characteristic absorption peak of OxTMB (650 nm) was recorded. 3. results and discussion  3.1. characterization of cu2−xse nps The nonstoichiometric Cu2−xSe nanoparticles were synthesized using a hydrothermal method.

As shown in Figure 1c, the full-scan XPS profiles confirmed that the nanoparticles contained Cu, Se and S elements, where S came from PSS. The ratio of Cu:Se was 3.81:2.05, which confirmed the formation of Cu2−xSe with x = 0.14 (Cu1.86Se). The high-resolution spectra showed a peak at 54.2 eV for Se 3d, which demonstrated the existence of Se2−, and the Cu 2p3/2 (932.2 eV), Cu 2p1/2 (952.0 eV) and a satellite binding energy peak (940–950 eV) was ascribed to the co-existence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) (Figure 1d,e) [52,53]. The as-prepared Cu2−xSe were suspended in water for an extinction measurement via UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. There was a strong LSPR band at 1025 nm, which was assigned to a high copper vacancy, and a shoulder absorption band at about 400–500 nm, which was ascribed to the direct band gap (Figure 1f). Compared to the metal nanoparticles with narrowband plasmonic resonance, which only allowed the utilization of a small portion of visible light, the Cu2−xSe with broadband NIR absorption was beneficial for enhancing the utilization efficiency of sunlight energy and also avoiding the wavelength limitation for photothermal sensing/imaging and therapy.

It was found that Cu2−xSe nanoparticles could have good enzyme activity in a wide range of pH and temperature, which was also an important advantage for further application. However, the absorbance at 650 nm declined, and the visible color was changed from blue to colorless with the addition of GSH, suggesting that GSH could dramatically inhibit the catalytic process of Cu2−xSe (Figure 2d). Meanwhile, the change in the absorption intensity at 650 nm varied with the GSH concentration. On the basis of the above phenomenon, a colorimetric method for the quantitative detection of GSH was designed by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 650 nm. 3.3. Optimization of Experimental Conditions The optimal experimental conditions were investigated by the univariate method, including pH, TMB concentration, Cu2−xSe concentration and H2O2 concentration. As shown in Figure S3a, the PBS buffer with a different pH was added to the system. With the increase in the pH value, the change in ΔA/A0 first increased and then decreased, and the maximum value was obtained when the pH was 6.5. Therefore, pH 6.5 was selected as the optimum value. Then, with the fixed pH at 6.5, different concentrations of TMB, Cu2−xSe and H2O2 were investigated in turn. As shown in Figure S3b–d, the maximum ΔA/A0 was reached when the concentration of TMB was 1.5 mM, Cu2−xSe was 25 µg/Ml, and H2O2 was 7.5 mM. To obtain a highly sensitive response for the quantitative detection of GSH, the final optimized conditions were as follows: Ph 6.5, TMB: 1.5 mM, Cu2−xSe NPs: 25 µg/mL and H2O2: 7.5 mM. i re 2. e a s r ti s ectra of Cu2−xSe-H2O2-TMB system under different conditions (inset: the solutions of TMB (a).

The interferences were investigated to evaluate the anti-interference capability of this sensing platform. As shown in Figure S4, no changes in the detection signal were observed which was compared to those of the control in the presence of GSH when the common interferences (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, glucose, lutamine, furfural, lysine, proline, valine and Vc) were added.

The NIR absorbance peak of Cu2−xSe has been proven to be a surface plasmon resonance with high vacancy concentrations and was widely used in the field of photothermal therapy [55] and photothermal immunoassay [56], etc. As shown in Figure 4a, under the irradiation of a 1064 nm laser (1.0 W/cm2), the temperature of the Cu2−xSe solution increased from room temperature rapidly to over 50 ◦C in 5 min. In contrast, there was little change in the temperature of pure water, indicating that the light energy could be efficiently absorbed and converted into heat, which is consistent with the previous reports [57]. The clear photothermal images were recorded using an IR camera (Figure 4b). It also showed excellent photothermal stability during four cycles of on/off laser irradiation, where no decay in the temperature was observed (Figure 4c).

However, when a certain amount of GSH was added (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 800 µM), the temperature of the Cu2−xSe solution decreased, and the image point captured by the thermal imager is shown in Figure 4f. It gradually changed from red to blue, indicating that the temperature gradually decreased. There was a direct relationship between the temperature change and the concentration of GSH; the relationship curve was fitted and had a good linear relationship in the range of 50–800 µM, wherein the LOD (3σ/k) was 39.27 µM (Figure 4e). This phenomenon could also provide a sensing protocol for GSH detection. . (a) Temperature change curves of Cu2−xSe with different concentrations under laser irradiation (1064 nm, 1.0 W/cm2).

However, when a certain amount of GSH was added (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 800 µM), the temperature of the Cu2−xSe solution decreased, and the image point captured by the thermal imager is shown in Figure 4f.

As shown in Figure 5a, in the presence of Cu2−xSe, the characteristic peaks of DMPO-·OH adducts were observed in the mixtures of DMPO and H2O2, indicating the generation of ·OH in the catalytic process. In addition, the signal intensity was enhanced with the Cu2−xSe concentration, which revealed that the catalytic activity of Cu2−xSe was

These results proved that the reaction mechanism between Cu2−xSe and H2O2 could be modeled by the Fenton reaction and the release of ·OH induced the oxidation of colorimetric reaction. However, with the addition of GSH, the signal intensity of DMPO-·OH adducts was decreased, which could inhibit the peroxidasemimicking activity.

The Cu2−xSe NPs were stable as there were no significant absorbance changes observed for 5 days (Figure S8). However, after the addition of GSH, the high-resolution Cu XPS characterization of Cu2−xSe, the copper species were basically Cu(I), indicating that the interaction between GSH and Cu2−xSe occurred (Figure 5b). When the Cu2−xSe NPs pretreated with GSH were purified and then incubated with TMB and H2O2, the absorption intensity 650 nm was also slightly decreased comp red to that n the Cu2−xSe-H2O2-TMB system (Figure S9). Furthermore, wh n the GSH was added to the Cu2−xSe soluti n, the NIR LSPR peak was red-shifted and had a decreased absorption tren (F gure 5c). Thus, the photothermal transduction efficiency was decreased as it was positively correlated with the absorpt on of Cu2−xSe NPs [31]. 4. conclusions In conclusion, a type of Cu2−xSe nanoparticles was used as both the nano-enzymatic and photothermal reagent. Because of the high copper deficiency, Cu(I)/Cu(II) coexisted in the Cu2−xSe nanoparticles and acted as a source of optically active holes. GSH, as a natural hole-scavenger, captured the holes of Cu2−xSe, inducing the peroxidase-like activity inhibition and the decreased photothermal efficiency, which were regulated by their reduced NIR LSPR. Therefore, a Cu2−xSe mediated colorimetric/photothermal dual-readout sensing platform for glutathione was developed and applied in the real samples with a satisfactory result.
