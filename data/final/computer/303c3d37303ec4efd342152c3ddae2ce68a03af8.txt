C. 3D Photo Stylization: Learning to Generate Stylized Novel Views from a Single Image The paper [4] introduces a new method called ’3D photo stylization’ that aims at synthesizing stylized novel views from a single content image with arbitrary styles. The method learns 3D geometry-aware features on a point cloud representation of the scene for consistent stylization across views without using 2D image features. The approach jointly models style transfer and view synthesis and doesn’t require ground-truth depth maps for training. The method demonstrates superior results and supports several interesting applications. d. depth-aware neural style transfer The paper [5] describes a novel approach for neural style transfer that integrates depth preservation as additional loss, preserving overall image layout while performing style transfer. It points out the limitation of existing deep neural network based image style transfer methods which fail to provide satisfactory results when stylizing the images containing multiple objects potentially at different depths. The proposed approach adds depth reconstruction loss to supplement it. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach retains the essential layout of the content image. e. semantic image synthesis with spatiallyadaptive normalization The paper [6] describes a new method called Spatially-Adaptive Normalization for synthesizing photorealistic images using an input semantic layout. The proposed method modulates the activations in normalization layers with a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation that effectively propagates the semantic information throughout the network. This results in improved image synthesis compared
to several state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by experiments on several challenging datasets. The proposed method also supports multi-modal and style-guided image synthesis, enabling controllable, diverse outputs. III. Project Plan
The aim of this project is to propose and evaluate a novel approach for 3D style transfer using RGBD images that incorporates depth heatmap information to generate more realistic and visually pleasing stylized outputs. Style transfer is a technique that involves transferring the style of one image onto another image while preserving its content. In this project, we will focus on transferring the style of a 2D image onto a 3D RGBD image, which poses technical challenges due to the additional dimension of depth information Fig. 4. We conducted a thorough review of existing literature on neural style transfer algorithms and their extensions to 3D photo stylization. Based on our findings, we proposed a novel approach that integrates depth heatmap information into the style transfer process to generate more realistic and visually pleasing stylized outputs. Our method takes RGB and depth images as inputs along with the heatmap of the RGB image, and we evaluated its performance in comparison to traditional neural style transfer approaches. The results showed that our proposed method outperformed the traditional approach, producing more realistic and visually pleasing stylized outputs. To evaluate the proposed method, we will conduct experiments on a dataset of RGBD images and measure the quality of the stylized outputs in terms of visual fidelity, color accuracy, and coherence of details. We will also compare our method’s performance with traditional neural style transfer approaches and analyze the impact of depth information on the stylization results. IV. Dataset Our proposed neural style transfer approach is highly flexible as it does not require a specific dataset to run the code. Instead, it can utilize any content image and any style image provided by the user. This feature makes our model highly adaptable and versatile, allowing for a wide range of creative possibilities. By removing the need for a specific dataset, our approach eliminates the constraints imposed by limited or biased datasets.The versatility of our model is one of its key advantages. It provides users with the ability to apply their preferred artistic style to any content image. This flexibility allows for a broader range of applications, from artistic expression to visual content creation for industries such as mobile photography, and AR/VR applications. Additionally, the ability to use any content and
style images reduces the time and resources needed for pre-processing and allows for faster experimentation with different styles and content. v. methodology We employed a two-code file approach to perform RGB-D image generation and style transfer. The methodology involves the following steps: a. rgb-d image generation and style transfer: In the first step, we generate an RGBD image from a given input image using the MiDaS (MidasNet) model for depth estimation. This involves installing the required packages and libraries, we used pre-trained MiDaS model, loading the input image and preprocessing it, loading the pre-trained depth model and creating a depth map, merging the input image and the depth map to generate an RGB-D image, applying a heatmap to visualize the depth information on the image, displaying the result and saving the heatmap image. b. style transfer : In the second step, we apply style transfer to the generated RGB-D image using the VGG19 model for feature extraction and a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model for style transfer. We define content and style representations using the VGG19 model, calculate style and content loss, and run gradient descent to optimize the
combined image. The stylized image is then saved. Our approach leverages the rich style information extracted from a pre-trained CNN model such as VGG-19, and utilizes the depth information from MiDaS to create an RGB-D image. The style transfer step uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model, and calculates both style and content loss to optimize the combined image. Our approach is a novel way to perform 3D style transfer that preserves spatial relationships and important features while transferring the style from a 2D image to a 3D scene. c. advantage of using depth and heatmap : The use of depth and heat maps in image stylization provides several advantages. First, depth maps provide a more accurate representation of the 3D structure of an image, which allows for more realistic stylization of objects in the scene. By taking into account the depth information and the heatmap of an image, stylization techniques can better preserve the spatial relationships between objects and their relative depth. This can be especially important for stylization techniques that rely on edge detection or color manipulation, as they can often lead to unnatural or distorted results if applied to objects with complex 3D geometry. VI. Results To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compared it with the traditional neural style transfer approach. We found that our method produces more realistic and visually pleasing style transfer outputs than the traditional method. Our approach incorporated depth heatmap information, which provided an adjustable way to control the structure of the artistically stylized result while focusing on the depth map and image edges. The proposed method improved the accuracy of color and style information in the stylized images. Our method can be applied to various computer vision applications such as image editing and virtual reality, where improved realism of generated images is crucial. Our approach has significant potential applications in computer graphics and image editing, as it can be extended to retain or enhance the structure of the artistically stylized result, which is an essential factor in evaluating the visual quality of the results. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of incorporating depth information and heatmap of RGB images in style transfer for more realistic results. VII. Applications The proposed approach for 3D style transfer using RGBD images has several potential applications in the field of computer vision
and graphics. One application is in the field of virtual reality and augmented reality, where realistic 3D stylized images can enhance the user’s immersive experience. The proposed approach can also be applied in the field of architectural visualization, where architects and designers can visualize their designs in 3D with different styles, textures, and colors. Another potential application is in the field of entertainment and animation, where the proposed approach can be used to create artistic stylized 3D animations and movies. Additionally, the proposed approach can also be used in the field of robotics, where robots can use 3D stylized images for object recognition and scene understanding. Overall, the proposed approach has several potential applications in various fields and can benefit researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision and graphics. VIII. Challenges
The proposed approach for 3D style transfer using RGBD images faced several challenges during its implementation. One of the main challenges was the lack of a large-scale RGBD dataset suitable for training the model. Another challenge was the difficulty of preserving the depth information of the input images while transferring the style. The proposed approach also faced challenges related to the complexity and computational requirements of the deep learning model. While the proposed method shows promise in improving the realism of generated images, the time required to generate an image can be a limiting factor for real-time applications such as AR/VR. Developing more efficient methods for style transfer can address this challenge. Additionally, the proposed approach required careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal results, which posed a challenge during the implementation. Other challenges include
handling missing or incomplete depth information, dealing with artifacts and inconsistencies in the stylized images, and ensuring the realism and coherence of the output images.
