The hippocampus is key to memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Previous work shows that neurons in the hippocampus fire in sequence to encode spatial information. The same group of cells will replay in memory consolidation, coupled with ripples, spindle, and slow waves. As for episodic memory, engram cells have been proposed to explain the encoding and transformation of episodic memory. Another universe theory about memory is the cognitive map theory. Here I use cognitive map theory as the bridge to overcome the gap between spatial and episodic memory. I believe spatial memory is a highly compressed case of episodic memory. In addition, I propose the hypothesis that engram can trigger sharp-wave ripples. I use a spike neural network-based computational model to verify this hypothesis. In conclusion, I believe engram cells and sharp-wave ripples are two different phenomena under a unified memory system. .

representation. Afterward, this representation can be extracted, consolidated, eliminated,
and manipulated. Researchers try to find the physical medium for this process. Eventually,
they discovered Engram. Memory engrams, also known as memory traces, were first
proposed by Semon in his work. Semon defines memory engrams as "stimulated, persistent,
latent modifications" [1]. Since then, the concept of engrams has been further enriched by
other researchers. Tonegawa is a representative scholar in this field. According to the previous work, engrams are considered the basic unit of memory. It
is not equivalent to memory but is highly related to the formation of memory. More
specifically, Engram cells refer to a cell population that satisfies the following conditions
[2]: (1) Cells that fire frequently during the learning process. To identify such cells,
biomarkers like c-Fos (an immediate early gene, IEG) can be used. (2) Cells that are
changed by the learning process and undergoing chemical or physical changes, such as the
excitability of cells, the density of dendrites and spines, and the strength of synapses. (3)
By activating these cells with external stimuli or optogenetics, related memory recall can
be triggered. Engram cells have primarily been studied under the behavioral paradigm of episodic
memory. A widely used behavioral paradigm for episodic memory is contextual fear
conditioning (CFC) [3]. Engram cells are not only located in a specific brain region but are
widely distributed across the brain. This property suggests that memories are not
represented by a specific brain region but are distributed encoded. As for the hippocampus,
engram cells that are related to episodic memory are found in the DG area. Existing
experimental evidence about engrams can be divided into three levels, including
observation [4-5], inhibition [6-9], and manipulation [10-13]. This evidence clarifies that
engrams are indeed mediators of memory formation and representation. 2. memory encoding – sequential firing and replay Another story about memory representation is sequential firing. Previous findings
proved that spatial memory is encoded by the sequential firing of neurons in the CA area. These cells are called place cells. Place cells always come up together with grid cells. They
work like the reference frame and coordinates. When a mouse runs forward in a maze, the
EC cortex will form a map of the maze with grid cells. And the mouse can locate its location
with place cells in the hippocampus. As place cells are binding to a specific spatial location,
they always fire in sequence to encode the time-varying coordinates of the mouse. That is
how sequential firing comes into being. During offline states such as sleep, information in the hippocampus is replayed. Place
cells in the hippocampus will fire in the same pattern as the exploration and learning period. This is called replay. Replay is essential for memory consolidation which transfers
information from the hippocampus into the isocortex. Experimental evidence shows that
interrupting the replay process will damage learning performance. To answer the question of how neurons in the hippocampus encode external
information, Daoyun Ji devised a spatial memory task to answer this question [14]. Mice
would run through a figure-of-eight maze, and the researchers recorded the activity of
neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The results showed that neurons encode
the spatial information of the maze by firing sequentially. Furthermore, during sleep, the
same set of neurons fires in the same pattern, a phenomenon known as "sequential replay." The researchers found that neuronal replay is highly coupled to sharp ripples, and replay
often occurs within sharp ripples. 3. memory syntax - sharp-wave ripples If engrams represent the basic unit of memory, the brain also needs grammar to
organize these "memory letters". This kind of grammar is called neural syntax, and its
specific manifestation is brain rhythms or neural oscillation [16]. There are many different
rhythmic oscillations in the brain, ranging from sharp-wave ripples, spindles, to slow waves. The mutual coupling between nerve rhythms of different frequencies creates a hierarchical
structure. This hierarchy provides a communication protocol for nerve impulses from
different regions. Ripples were first observed by Cornelius Vanderwolf in 1969, after which John
O'Keefe discovered place cells associated with sharp ripples [15]. Buzsaki then studied the
role of sharp ripples in detail [16]. Sharp wave ripples are a compound waveform that
occurs in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain associated with
memory and learning, and sharp wave ripples are also thought to be involved in the
consolidation and retrieval of memories. Sharp wave ripples are one of the characteristic waves during slow wave sleep [17]. According to different characteristic waves, sleep can be divided into REM sleep and non-
REM sleep. Non-REM sleep can be further divided into several stages, of which stages 3-
4 are called slow-wave sleep (Slow-wave Sleep, SWS). Slow wave sleep has three
characteristic waves, including sharp wave ripples from the hippocampus, spindle waves
from the thalamus, and slow waves from the cerebral cortex. Sharp ripples, spindles, and slow waves all occur in slow-wave sleep, and there must
be some connection between them. According to Feld et al. [18], these three waves are
phase-locked during sleep. Spike ripples accompany the replayed message, synchronized
with the spindle excitation period of the thalamus. The spindles themselves are
synchronized with the ascending phase of the cortical slow waves. During non-REM sleep,
the synchronization of these three waves establishes a pathway of information from the
hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. 4. memory consolidation S Diekelmann proposed a two-stage memory consolidation model (Diekelmann &
Born, 2010). During the wake stage, outside information is encoded by the cortex based on
pre-existing long-term memory and the hippocampus will form temporary memory. Then
during SWS sleep, the temporary memory will be reactivated in the form of replay for
memory consolidation. After that, during REM sleep, synapsis will be consolidated and
normalized. As an important process of the memory system, memory consolidation is highly related
to memory engrams and neural oscillations. Memory consolidation refers to the process of
transforming the temporary and unstable representation of external information entering
the brain into a more stable and structured long-term representation [19]. This process can
be divided into two levels, namely the cellular level and the systemic level. At the cellular
level, the representation of information depends on physical or chemical updates of the cell
state [20-21]. and changes in the strength of synapses [19]. At the system level, the initial
representation of memory will be further abstracted and transformed, especially in the
offline state. This process involves communication and cooperation between several brain
regions. Information flows between regions, incorporating new memories into existing
ones. During this process, engram cells change. According to existing research, engrams
are highly dynamic and can undergo bidirectional transformation between silent and active
states. Memory consolidation is compared with the maturity of engrams. Engram cells will
transform from silent into active during the consolidation process [22]. This phenomenon
happens across multi-areas including the hippocampus [23-24], mPFC, and BLA [25]. As for spatial memory, Gabrielle Girardeau devised a reward-based behavioral
paradigm for spatial memory consolidation [26]. Mice will be shocked either during the
sharp ripple (experimental group) or after the sharp ripple (control group). The results
showed that when the sharp wave ripples were disturbed, the mice performed worse on a
spatial memory task. This experiment demonstrates that sharp wave ripples play an
essential role in spatial memory consolidation. 5. cognitive map theory Regarding how the hippocampus encodes various knowledge, cognitive map theory
assumes that everything could be represented by a graph structure. Everything is a
relationship in the brain [16]. The psychophysical curve shows that our brains do not
encode abstract value, physical value is encoded in the log form. This evidence supports
the idea that the brain represents this world by relationship. In graph theory, every graph
can be represented by a set of nodes and edges. In other words, we can represent any
relationship in the form of a graph. Based on the abstract relationship, we can bind
conceptual objects into this graph. This mechanism can be used to explain how creatures
encode spatial maps and non-spatial relationships [27]. a unified theory Here we argue that sharp-wave ripples and engram cells are two different phenomena
under a unified memory system from three aspects. 1) Using the cognitive map theory to
unify the encoding of spatial and episodic memory. 2) Using a dynamic autoencoder
conceptual model to unify static memory fingerprint and dynamic time-varying memory
trace. 3) Using a spike neural network-based computation model to verify that the engram
can trigger sharp-wave ripples. These three pieces of evidence resolve three divergences of
sharp-wave ripples and engram cells respectively. Sharp-wave ripples are observed in the CA1 area and coupled with sequential firings. Sequential
firings are coupled with spatial memory. Engram cells are observed in the DG area, which encodes
episodic memory. spatial and episodic memory representation One divergence between sharp-wave ripples and engram cells is that they encode
different forms of memory (Figure 1). Experimental evidence shows that sequential firing
and sharp-wave ripples are always coupled. And sequential firing is found in spatial
memory encoding in the hippocampus area with place cells. However, engram cells are
about episodic memory like a contextual-based reward or aversion memory. Lucky,
sequential firing, sharp-wave ripples, and engram cells all have been observed in the
hippocampus. Here I argue that
Animals are natively drawn on profits and avoid loss. They can learn in which
environment there will have a higher chance to find food or enemies. This is called episodic
memory. Animals also have spatial memory since they need to remember where is their
home and where can collect resources. On the one hand, place cells are spatial in their
nature, so perhaps the replay is a spatial-specific phenomenon. On the other hand, since
the circuit and cellular machinery for the spatial replay are already in place, it is possible
other types of memory can use this machinery if they also have a sequential pattern. This
has not been sufficiently studied before. Here we use cognitive map theory to merge that fork of spatial memory and episodic
memory. We argue that spatial memory is a special case of episodic memory. As it is
mentioned in the cognitive theory and Buzaski’s work [16]. The brain uses a relative
relationship to encode this world. We argue that the brain uses graph structure to represent
the episodic context. Spatial memory, as a spatial case, is a well-formed graph with
limitations. Spatial memories are always represented as a chain (straight channel) or
honeycomb-like grid (open field). When a mouse runs on the ground, its spatial memory is a time-varying trace. This
property leads to sequential firing phenomena observed in the hippocampus. However,
episodic memory is much more complex. Features in context are much more enriched
compared with simple coordinates in the open field. Thus, the relationship represented by
the brain will be much more complex. Discover such a pattern is more computationally
expensive compared with a simple chain-like structure. This might be the reason why
encoding patterns about episodic memory is not discovered in the experiment yet. Spatial memory is a special case of episodic memory. Every frame in the spatial memory is
compressed into a single coordinate point. That’s why sequential firing can be observed. According to the cognitive map theory, everything can be represented by a relation
map. In every temporal frame, episodic memory can be encoded by a static graph. The
graph can evolve dynamically to reflect the temporal variance of the context (As shown in
Figure 2 Top Right Corner). The corresponding neuron firing pattern is more complex
rather than simple sequential firing. Here I believe spatial memory is a kind of highly
compressed episodic memory. In spatial memory, detailed context information is ignored
and only a single coordinate is recorded. This is why we can find sequential firing in spatial
memory: it is a kind of highly abstract context that only keeps coordinate information. dynamic autoencoder conceptual model Another divergence between sharp-wave ripples and engram cells is static fingerprint
and dynamic sequence. Sharp-wave ripples are coupled with sequential firing. In the traditional experiment, engrams are a kind of spatial pattern in the DG area. The temporal property of engrams is not well-studied. In my hypothesis, the engram can trigger sharpwave ripples. In the meanwhile, some papers believe that sharp-wave ripples can trigger sequential firing. Here I argue that it is a reasonable system to store information static in the form of spatial patterns (engram) and extract information with dynamic activities (sequential firing). This paper believes that the working mode of forming a firing sequence through an
initial stimulus is in corresponds with the phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics and the current attractor theory. Such modes enhance the reliability of neural encodings while preserving plasticity. Representing and storing sequences in the form of initial values, and using plastic manifold spaces to decompress the initial points is a faster way to represent, store, and read information efficiently. As shown in Figure 3, the encoder encodes the information and maps it to an initial point on the manifold surface. The trajectory of the initial point is described by a nonlinear dynamical system, which produces a trajectory over time. This trajectory is then sampled by the decoder, generating a sequential output. Within the framework of this model, the activation of engram cells sets the initial value. Under the description of the nonlinear dynamic equation, the initial value is decompressed into a trajectory unfolding with time, which also generates sequential information. This sequential information is the sequential firing observed in the experiment. In previous work, it was proposed that the hippocampus can be considered an autoencoder, and the theory is extended here in conjunction with a dynamic autoencoding model. The encoder sets an initial value on the manifold, and the subsequent movement of the initial coordinates is described by a nonlinear dynamical system. Its time-varying motion trajectory is sampled by the decoder to generate a sequential output. This conceptual model is supported by many studies. Benna et al. [28] argue that the
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus constitute an autoencoder. Jaffe et al. [29] proposed a task-dependent dynamic self-variational encoder [30] to model human behavior. The encoding from an initial point to a trajectory is a universal computational principle in the
brain. In the field of motion control, Wang et al. [31] mentioned that the motor cortex generates temporal motion commands according to the dynamic evolution of the trajectory by setting the initial value. In the field of value coding and decision-making, Okazawa et al. [32] found that population neuron coding forms a manifold space in the lateral parietal cortex. In the computational model of working memory, Bi et al. [33] believed that the track length encoded the delay time between different stimulus signals. This paper argues that memory consolidation and representation can also be included under the framework of this universal computational principle. spike neural network-based computational model Biological experiments are constrained by equipment, instruments, reagents, and
experimental methods. The verification and observation of new phenomena require a long experimental cycle and may involve many interference factors. Therefore, starting from the existing experimental results, we leveraged a computational model to verify the hypothesis that engram cells can trigger sharp-wave ripples. 1. tri-synaptic pathway in the hippocampus There are a large number of excitatory and inhibitory cells in the CA1 and CA3
regions, and the calculation model also shows that the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cells is required to construct the attractor model. Excitatory and inhibitory cells play a role in homeostasis. As shown in Figure 4, there are a large number of projections from the DG area to CA3 and then to CA1, forming a tri-synaptic loop. The sharp waveripples phenomenon is similar to the damped oscillation phenomenon. Thus, activation of engrams in the DG region may introduce an additional input in the CA3 region [34]. Inputs to the DG disrupt the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA, producing ripples. And the forward sharp wave will also induce the chain firing of neurons along the way, realizing the phenomenon of sequential firing. In short, the sharp-wave ripples might be an energy dissipation phenomenon in the excitatory-inhibition balanced system. The DG-CA3-CA1 connectivity pathway is referred to as the tri-synaptic pathway. A multicompartment model is used for the CA3 and CA1 regions. Arrows represent projection relationships. Orange represents inhibitory and blue represents excitatory. In the multi-compartment model, the circle represents the soma and the rectangle represents the axon. 2. energy view of the e-i balanced system As shown in Equation 1, the equation is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model. This
model describes the relationship between the neuronal membrane potential and the input current. The CA3 and CA1 regions are considered as an entirety. From the perspective of charge, the only input quantity of the whole system is the drive current 𝐼𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒 from the DG region reaches the CA3 region through the Mossy pathway. The charge brought by the drive current will be stored by the neuron in the form of membrane potential and released in the form of the action potential. From this perspective, the whole model of the hippocampus can be thought of as a capacitor. 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐼𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦 + 𝐼𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝐼𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒 (1)
Both CA3 and CA1 contain two groups of neurons, excitatory neurons and inhibitory
neurons. Simply thinking about the relationship between the two groups of neurons, we can know that they constitute a self-feedback stable system. The self-feedback system can be simply extended to the analysis of charge storage. Taking the CA1 region as an example, the input of the Schaffer pathway leads to an increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons. An increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons leads to an increase in the membrane potential of inhibitory neurons, thereby inhibiting the increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons. The increased energy can be released in the form of higher firing frequency of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In the
meantime, the whole system maintains a stable state. In other words, the two groups of neurons work in antagonism. But something will change in the system. A higher rate of action potential firing leads to more charges being consumed. But the entire system maintains a dynamic balance, and the amount of charges will not accumulate infinitely. From the perspective of energy, sharp-wave ripples are the result of the energy
explosion. Therefore, a reasonable deduction is that the generation of sharp-wave ripples must be accompanied by a decrease in the amount of stored charge in the neuron population. It has also been found that the synchronous firing of CA1 inhibitory neurons can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples [35]. This phenomenon can also be explained from the perspective of charge storage. If the CA1 area is regarded as a capacitor, it is assumed that its input from CA3 does not change but an external input enhances the firing of inhibitory neurons in the CA1 region. This leads to a decrease in the overall action potential firing rate in the CA1 region, resulting in an increase in stored charge. Sudden cessation of external input in the CA1 region will cause excitatory neurons to fire in bursts. By releasing excessive charge, sharp-wave ripples will be generated. Based on this mechanism, sharpwave ripples can also be induced by a sudden increase in external input, and this phenomenon has also been successfully observed in a computational model. 3. modeling results - Sharp-Wave Ripples
This paper examined sharp-wave ripples on a computational model of the
hippocampus. Please refer to supplementary materials for more details about the computational model. By simulating neuronal activity in the hippocampus over 4 s, we recorded the membrane potential of neurons in the CA1 region. Local field potentials were calculated based on membrane potentials. Energy density measurements are performed on the field potential to identify sharp ripple events. The result is shown in Figure 5. Sharp-wave ripples detected in computational models of the hippocampus. The blue curve is a sharp wave, which is obtained by bandpass the local field potential signal from 5 Hz to 20 Hz. The orange curve is the ripple, which is obtained by bandpass the field potential signal from 80 Hz to 180 Hz. The yellow horizontal line is the baseline, representing zero potential. - Trigger Sharp-Wave Ripples by Temporary Enhanced Input
The paradigms above provide a possible mechanism for the generation of sharp-wave
ripples from the perspective of neuron population charge. Based on this mechanism, a reasonable inference can be drawn: the disturbance brought by the input of the DG area disrupts the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA1 and CA3 areas, resulting in sharp-wave ripples. To test this hypothesis, the following experiments were performed in a computational model of the hippocampus. As shown in Figure 4, DGCA3-CA1 constitutes a tri-synaptic pathway. Activation of engram cells in the DG will lead to temporarily enhanced input of the Mossy pathway. This paper simulates the activation of engram cells in the DG region by artificially changing the input current intensity of the CA3 region. Through experiments, it was found that the temporary enhancement of the Mossy pathway can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples. As shown in Figure 6, the drive current in the CA3 area is shown by the orange curve, and it will switch between 2.3𝑢𝐴~3𝑢𝐴 in a period of 1 second. The blue curve is the local field potential in the CA1 area. The blue line represents the local field potential of the CA1 region, and the orange line represents the input drive current of the CA3 region. The drive current fluctuates between 2.3~3 𝜇𝐴 with a period of 1s to simulate the temporary enhancement of DG input. As the input from the DG region switches between augmented and normal input on a
one-second cycle, the probability of sharp-ripple events in the CA1 region changes. In this paper, the activity of the hippocampal region was simulated for 4 s each time, and after 40 repetitions, the frequency of sharp-wave ripples in the CA1 region was detected. The results are shown in Figure 7, the occurrence frequency of sharp ripples in the enhanced input period is significantly higher than that in the normal input period. This result supports the hypothesis that temporarily enhanced input to the DG region can induce sharp-wave ripples. Another possibility is that the enhanced input itself causes more sharp-wave ripples. After experimenting with the computational model, it is found that the absolute value of the drive current does not determine the frequency of sharp ripples. The key factor is the step switch of the drive current. Stats graph and hypothesis testing proved that temporary enhancement of DG input can trigger sharpwave ripples in the CA1 area. Run 4 s simulation 40 times. ***p < 0.001, Wilcox test. conclusion & future work The hippocampus is proven to play a key role in memory encoding, consolidation, and
retrieval. Place cells fire in sequence to encode spatial memory. Previous studies show that
ripples, spindles, and slow waves will synchronously transform information between the
hippocampus and cortex. The engram cell theory was first proposed by Semon, and Tonegawa further developed
this theory, which was supported by experimental evidence at three levels: observation,
loss of function, and gain of function. The long-term enhancement theory has revealed the
neural mechanism of memory and learning at the cellular level. Engram formation is
dependent on long-term potentiation, an increase in dendritic spines, and an increase in
cellular excitability. Multiple brain regions are involved in this process, including the
hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala. Various regions
complete this process through cooperation and produce a joint effect. However, there are
still many questions to be answered. Questions for further research include how to achieve
retrieval, consolidation, and representation of different memories in a unified system. At
the same time, we also need to explore the information exchange mode of engram cells in
different brain regions and understand the role of engram cells in different types of memory. To better study these topics, we need more advanced neural recording technology and more
refined neural manipulation methods. Future studies will use higher temporal and spatial
resolution methods to explore the changes of engram cells during learning and the
formation of different types of memories. Like wave-particle duality, static engram cells and dynamic sequential firing should
be regarded as two representations of the same memory system. If the engram cell theory
is regarded as a static memory mark, the sharp-wave ripples and the accompanying
sequential replay can be regarded as a dynamic representation with highly temporal
characteristics. The main research on the replay phenomenon has focused on spatial
memory, while the research on engram cells has focused on episodic memory. But this
paper thinks that these two forms should be equivalent and have a causal relationship. This paper analyzed the generation mechanism of sharp-wave ripples from the
perspective of computational neuroscience. Combining the charge perspective and the self-
feedback mechanism, the possible reasons for the sharp-wave ripples are expounded. Based
on this mechanism, this paper proposes the hypothesis that the activation of engram cells
can induce sharp wave ripples, and has been verified in a computational model. In addition,
this hypothesis can be verified by observing the engram and sequence firing at the same
time. The verification experiment needs to be conducted by other researchers. At the model
level, I hope to answer the following questions: 1) Different engram cells correspond to
different memories, how to make different engram cells activate different sequence replays
in the model? 2) How to add new memory engrams to the existing network model? 3) How
do old engrams affect the representation of new engrams in the hippocampus? supplementary materials The temporal dynamics of neurons are described by the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Specifically, the two-compartment model from the paper by Ramirez-Villegas et al. [36] was used, consisting of two parts, the soma, and the axon.
